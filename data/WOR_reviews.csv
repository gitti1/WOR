The intervention speaks back to correcting misperceptions, but literature on violence shows that needs to go with local discussions on the nature of harm and protection, because attitudes and norms might be synchronous.

The authors make great use of the concept of “pluralistic ignorance”, when norms and individual attitudes are not aligned. This is an insightful concept, but it’s important to stress that the opposite can also (and quite often is) true: social norms and individual attitudes can be aligned; norms can actually shape those attitudes (as scholars working in the gender theory field might argue).ResponseThanks for these excellent criticisms. Responding to them underlies many of the changes we have made to the paper.We have added to the introduction some text on reasons for compliance with norms:“Why we do what we do is complicated and norms are only part of the story. For example, a behaviour might be sustained or prevented by social structures such as laws and institutions, material contributors such as wealth (or lack of it), or the availability of services. It might equally be driven by personal beliefs, self-confidence, and aspirations. From an economic perspective, norms are supported by coordination, social pressure, signalling, and anchoring. Coordination allows individuals to express themselves in shared languages – literally and metaphorically – and benefits both them and the collective. Social pressure encourages individuals not to act purely in their own interest, but that of the collective. Signalling and symbolism allow individuals to identify with (or, equally, indicate their lack of identification with) social groups. Anchoring effectively sets benchmarks for behaviour within a smaller range than what is possible, an example being the ages at which women and men marry.”We have added a mention of the strength of norms we identified in the discussion:“Why should this be so? It seems to us that the areas of greater discrepancy – loosely, where norms might be seen as weaker - reflect both societal change and resource constraint. Many precedents, campaigns, and programs encourage female education, and this is augmented by the observation that, in urban Mumbai at least, girls nowadays usually go to school. In this sense, the descriptive norm favours female education – up to a point – and perhaps the injunctive norm is itself changing. Urban life is expensive and people are time-poor. Women need to be able to manage household expenses and income from their own employment. At the same time, the gendered division between reproductive and productive work has historically meant that domestic parsimony and responsibility are characteristics of a good wife and mother. Whether or not there is increasing permissiveness toward premarital sex, the penalties for young women can be severe. Young men, however, have traditionally been granted the privilege of premarital sexual relationships and, although this licence may have more of a passive than an active character, it is arguably part of their gender role.”We have also tried to make pluralistic ignorance less of a feature of the paper and it is now mentioned on once. The authors use gender and social norms almost interchangeably; it would be important to understand if they think they differ at all. The social norms construct they use comes from a social psychology, but much theory around gender norms has been developed by scholars conceptually distant from Cialdini and colleagues. The authors mention that examples of community mobilisations are rare; they do mention some of these examples and could also mention well-known cases. In addition, they could look at the case of social norms and intimate partner violence in Southern India discussed in Cislaghi & Bhattacharjee 2017.ResponseThanks again. We have added a clarification on gender norms to the introduction:“The resistance of social norms to change varies. They may be sensitive to changes in social networks and to the influence of individuals who emerge as role models or deviants, and their supporting matrix may be complex. For example, violence against women is unlikely to be sustained by a single norm and often occurs at the intersection of gender norms that are permissive rather than supportive. A gender norm is a kind of social norm that describes shared social expectations of behaviour specific to gender. It tends to emerge from gender ideology and attitudes that have themselves led to socially constructed gender roles; for example, valuing sons over daughters, idealised conceptions of femininity, and traits that signal masculinity. Most of our discussion is about gender norms that legitimise imbalances of power and, by extension, inequalities in access to resources. Glibly, we might think of these as archetypes of the good woman and the real man: constructs that may hinder change rather than actively support violence, but contribute to imbalances of power.”We have included other sources of scholarship in the introduction…“From an economic perspective, norms are supported by coordination, social pressure, signalling, and anchoring. Coordination allows individuals to express themselves in shared languages – literally and metaphorically – and benefits both them and the collective. Social pressure encourages individuals not to act purely in their own interest, but that of the collective. Signalling and symbolism allow individuals to identify with (or, equally, indicate their lack of identification with) social groups. Anchoring effectively sets benchmarks for behaviour within a smaller range than what is possible, an example being the ages at which women and men marry.”… and in the discussion:“Norms are characterized by persistence, punctuated equilibrium and tipping points, compression (the range of individual choices varies less than one might expect), and local conformity within global diversity.”… and:“From a psychological perspective, emphasizing a descriptive norm that differs substantially from an injunctive norm could be expressed as ‘personalised normative feedback’ in which people are shown the discrepancies between their estimates of what is usual and what is actually usual.”We have given examples from India in the discussion:“Several programs have worked to change norms in India. The Samata program seeks to reduce HIV acquisition and child marriage through changing education norms for lower caste girls in Karnataka state. Also in Karnataka, Samvedana Plus addresses violence against sex-working women. The Yari-dosti program promotes gender equity among young men in low-income communities in Mumbai, and PRACHAR sought to improve young people’s sexual and reproductive health in Bihar.” Methods Study procedures are very thoroughly explained and well thought. Sometimes, however, the “provisional normative statements” included in Table 1 leave the doubt on whether those statements are all socially normative or morally normative. The difference is sometimes subtle and understandings can overlap.ResponseWe have added to the methods section:“While most of the examples were gender norms, a few – “boys will be boys,” “women should not have sex before marriage,” and “it is a good woman’s duty to make her husband’s family happy” - had the character of more general moral norms.” Results The results offer a solid qualitative social norms analysis. Authors could have mapped the descriptive and injunctive norms in a table, to show their concordance or discordance. Sometimes it is not completely clear whether authors are looking at norms as defined in the social psychology literature they cite in the intro, or more in the way they have been articulated in applied gender work (for instance at p.8).ResponseThanks. We made a table, but then thought that a summary diagram might be nicer, and added Figure 1. Discussion Some of these findings resonate with a similar study conducted in Southern India and that would probably be an interesting read for the authors (8). The discussion brings in gender norms as a construct but – as mentioned earlier – more understanding of what gender norms actually are (and how they relate the Cialdini’s social norms used by the authors) would be helpful.ResponseWe hope that the revisions we have mentioned previously are an adequate response to this comment. Conclusions An understanding of the difference between outgroup and ingroup is missing. That is dangerous, because (as the work by Kees Keiser shows) implementing interventions that do not target the right group can increase compliance with the harmful norms with the outgroups (“that message is not for me – I’d better do X even more to make sure people know I am not one of those”). The intervention speaks back to correcting misperceptions, but literature on violence shows that needs to go with local discussions on the nature of harm and protection, because attitudes and norms might be synchronous. As mentioned earlier, the conclusions overstate the importance of pluralistic ignorance: evidence from West Africa suggests that dialogue can increase the mismatch between attitudes and norms or descriptive and injunctive norms required to bring change at scale.ResponseAs mentioned before, we have cut down the mention of pluralistic ignorance. We have also added to the discussion in-group and out-group issues, which we found a particularly interesting insight from the reviewer:“A corollary of group behaviour is that an individual can use its symbolic features to either identify herself as a member (in-group) or to identify a group as an entity of which she is decidedly not a member (out-group). Efforts to change norms may therefore look to participants distancing themselves from groups that maintain behaviours seen as unjust, or shifting their identification to groups with more conducive norms. We would argue that the ubiquity of action groups, communities of interest, and identity politics implies that individuals are able to find safe harbour in a reference group that they have chosen as reflecting their own aspirations and differing from those of others.”",9,11,2017,2017-11-9,PMC5680532,Research Article,29164180,NA,You can't burn the house down because of one bedbug: a qualitative study of changing gender norms in the prevention of violence against women and girls in an urban informal settlement in India.,2017-11-07,research-article; journal article;

However, we understand that this could be mitigated by using the dataset of clients at the counseling center. It is very much appreciated that you have published your vignette script, it is a great service to other organizations conducting this type of research in India.ResponseWe have mentioned this in the discussion in a new paragraph on limitations of the study.“There were some limitations to our study. We purposefully interviewed more women than men and we chose an informal settlement which – though very large and occupied by communities of diverse origin – may limit generalisation. The use of vignettes might also have led to a focus on the scenarios that they included, to the exclusion of other possible issues. We have some assurance, however, from the extensive dataset of client records on which the vignettes were based.” It would also have been great to include a bit more information included on the Framework Analysis approach and how it was applied.ResponseWe have added to the paragraph in the methods:“Because focus groups and interviews followed a semi-structured sequence, we began with a list of general coding categories, which we expanded and sub-categorised into a coding tree in a series of team discussions. These categories described types of gender norm, response to transgression, and classification as descriptive or injunctive. We revisited the analysis repeatedly over six months, reviewing individual transcripts and hierarchies of categorical codes in an effort to achieve a higher level of thematic description. We settled on the comparison of descriptive and inductive norms early, but the idea of the importance of reference groups emerged much later.” Results It is not discussed why there more women recruited than men (56 women and only 15 men). It is unclear as to whether this was intentional or not? If intentional, that should be stated. If not, it would be great to have some discussion on the challenges of recruiting men for the study.ResponseIt was intentional and we have added to the methods paragraph:“A purposive sample of female and male participants represented two age groups (18-30 and 30-55 years) and four localities. We intentionally included more women than men because our preventive program works primarily with women as drivers of norm change.” We would also be careful with comparing Hindu and Muslim women in the second column of page 8 since the sample is limited to 5 women in the in-depth interviews for each.ResponseWe agree and have removed mention of this. Discussion and Conclusion It would be great if the authors could provide some thoughts on why there were more substantial differences between injunctive and descriptive norms around women’s education, control of income and finances, and premarital sexual relationships, but not in the other areas covered in this study.ResponseWe have added to the early part of the discussion:“Why should this be so?

Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.13676.r27573,Lindgren,Arne,NA,"1Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Neurology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden",approve,"This is a study of 290 subjects with lacunar stroke from the Edinburgh Stroke Study and 990 subjects with lacunar stroke plus 939 control subjects from the UK Lacunar Stroke Resource. The authors examined if there was an association between variants in
TREX1 and lacunar stroke but could not detect this. This is an important and relevant finding because when taking previous reports into consideration it has been reasonable to suspect a relation between
TREX1 variants and lacunar stroke. Some comments: Microangiopathy can cause many different phenotypes and a discussion about how closely the different microangiopathies noted in previous studies of
TREX1 can be supposed to be related to the phenotype lacunar stroke would be of interest. Maybe the reported microangiopathies should instead be suspected to be related to other phenotypes than lacunar stroke? It would therefore be valuable if the authors, with their acknowledged expertise, in the manuscript could explain more about the possible relationships between microangiopathy and SVD causing lacunar stroke. For clarity of the manuscript, the authors should consider moving some parts of the Results section to the Methods section. This includes the paragraph beginning with “The UK Young Lacunar Stroke Resource (UKYLSR) is a study of approximately 1,000 patients” and the sentences starting with: “We therefore next considered annotations of these variants which evaluated the potential pathogenicity of a given variant. CADD is a method…” The authors also used mouse
TREX1 for their evaluations. It would be valuable if they could comment in e.g. their Discussion whether any differences between mouse
TREX1 and human
TREX1 may be of importance. Suggest that the authors omit the sentence “p = 0.005, Fishers Exact Test compared to published control cohort” from the legend of Table 1.

There are several points though that the authors should consider addressing. Authors:
The authors are to be commended on putting together their remarkable cohorts – numbers are impressive. Several reports of “associations” such as in Reference 20 are under powered and the authors nicely point this out.Another point to make is that RVCL mutations are frame-shift. The protein these patients produce is lacking its COOH-tail. TREX1 is on the “loose” so to speak. The variants identified herein in the COOH tail in stroke or control cohorts herein would thus not be expected to lead to RVCL.The authors should comment that testing for the presence of lacunar stroke is not the same as testing for accelerated small vessel disease. We don’t see lacunar strokes in patients with RVCL/CRV/TREX1 vasculopathy. The ischemic damage is even on a smaller scale (truly a microangiopathy).A medical biostatistician specially in genetics should review this paper.

NA,NA,Bancone,Germana,NA,"Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, Thailand",NA,"We thank the reviewer for his useful comments and suggestions. Below the answer to his questions. Q1) The subject of study; inherited red cell variants are valid in itself. It is controversial whether heterozygous G6PD mutation, thalassemia traits, and ABO, Rh blood groups are 'disorders'. People with all of these conditions do not have anemia in their usual state. Only people with compound heterozygous thalassemia 'diseases', homozygous HbE (HbEE), and HbH will have some degree of anemia. The causes of anemia in pregnant women are by far commonly caused by iron deficiency, which is not addressed in this study. Therefore the reference to anemia in pregnancy should be de-emphaized in the rationale and conclusion of this study.  A1) Anaemia is the most common medical problem of the pregnant population under study and is associated with  maternal mortality (
McGready, Boel et al. 2012) but a systematic analysis of genetic causes of anemia has never been undertaken. We think that, although analyzing these markers is interesting in itself, we cannot avoid highlighting that our primary interest is their contribution to anaemia during pregnancy; our plan is also to analyse soon clinical data in relation to the findings presented in this manuscript. Following the reviewers suggestions, we have re-phrased some of the text in the introduction and conclusion to clarify our message. Q2) G6PD results in this report does confirm other studies in Myanmar ethnic groups, many of which were reported in males. One additional citation that the author should consider is a report from Louicharen

In this paper in which details are reported in supplementary article in Science website. the prevalence of G6PD deficiency 20%, with predominantly (94%) Mahidol variant.  A2) We have added the suggested citation Q3) The methodology for estimating prevalence of alpha-thalassemia trait in this paper is controversial. Using low HbA2 is known to be unreliable and in fact the authors showed only 44.1% specificity. Since it is known how much is alpha-tha are missed in people with normal A2, the total prevalence is therefore not known for certainty.  The prevalence of alpha-thalassemia in subset of studies in known beta-thal trait population may be more accurate estimation assuming all subjects were tested, but need to be stratified by each ethnic group. The author may wish state a conservative estimate in each ethnic group, like at least 25%, instead of a specific proportion. A3) As we answered also to the other reviewer, we have modified all the text and Tables to improve accuracy and clarity on this point. Q4) Due to large number of Karen and Burmans in this study, the author may wish to point out the value of this paper in population genetics. Their difference in prevalence was a founder effect and due to estimation of G6PD Mahidol variant emerging around 1500 years ago
1 as protective factor against malaria, the Burman may be a more recent population in this region.  A4) Although this is an interesting point to consider, the current data were not collected or analyzed to support or contradict evolutionary dynamics of Karen and Burman populations, therefore we prefer not to address the topic. Q5) In the final conclusion paragraph, the author should made a summary statement of their key findings on prevalence of variants but not about anemia since this paper did not address the issue. A mention of newer marker for iron deficiency detection is irrelevant and not useful in this resource-limited region. Suggestion of counseling is irrelevant and impractical here.  A5) We have revised the text of the conclusive paragraph. We strongly believe that, having found a pretty high prevalence of abnormal Hb variants, a discussion on counselling pregnant women is warranted in this setting. Though this counselling is time-intensive and challenging, it is feasible in low resource settings with appropriately trained and sensitive local staff. Furthermore, better diagnostic tools for iron-deficient anaemia during pregnancy have been shown to be particularly useful in populations with a high prevalence of haemoglobin disorders (
Wray, Allen et al. 2017); our data bring evidence on the widespread distribution of IRD and on the need for testing in resource-limited areas.",23,10,2017,2017-10-23,PMC5686509,Research Article,29181452,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12338.2,Prevalences of inherited red blood cell disorders in pregnant women of different ethnicities living along the Thailand-Myanmar border.,2017-11-02,research-article; journal article;

I would either drop those data or alter the rationale to justify their inclusion.  2) The referencing could be improved throughout the introduction. For example, a reference for Lyonisation and G6PD activity could be added, and the third paragraph, which contains a lot of technical information, should be referenced along the way rather than through the bunching of 4 (slightly random) references at the end. 3) Introduction paragraph 3 could be tightened up. The first sentence is a bit confused: “..structural variants and deletional mutations on the hemoglobin …. chains” is a bit of a mixture of nomenclature more usually specific to either the protein or the gene.  The “deletional mutations” more commonly refer to the gene than the protein and probably more correctly should be referred to as “genetic deletions” rather than mutations (which more commonly relate to sequence changes than deletions).  Further down, “…97% of hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two beta chains” – the authors should clarify that they’re talking about ADULT haemoglobin (HbA). The references on the geographic distribution with malaria are a bit random and refer to different IRDs. A recent authoritative review would probably be a better way to go.   4) Methods: Lab analyses. It would be very helpful if the authors explained here on behalf of the non-expert what the G6PD spot test is designed to do and at what level of normal G6PD activity the test turns positive. A major issue with this test, as the authors acknowledge, is that it is a binary test that shows sufficient / deficient only. It is not designed to pick up heterozygotes and is only partially sensitive for homozygotes, depending on the genotype involved and the degree to which it perturbs G6PD production.  Some discussion of this in the methods section would help the non-expert reader. 5)  In the same section, the authors state that the quantitative test was conducted in “selected women”. It took me some digging to find that it was actually conducted in “a sub-set of sequentially recruited [and therefore “unselected”] women”. This could be better phrased at this point. 6) It would help the reader if the flow chart (Figure 1) could be amended to make the above more clear with regard to the quantitative test and the genotyping for both G6PD and other conditions.  7)  Methods; haemobloginopathies.  The authors used an HbA2 of <2.2 or <2.1% (depending on the method) to define “presumptive” carrier status for alpha-thalassaemia.  As the authors state later in the paper, this is neither a sensitive nor specific approach to the diagnosis of the alpha-thalassaemias overall. It’s almost useless for the carrier forms of the common minor single gene -3.7 and -4.2kb deletional forms of the condition.  As such, the authors’ focus on this sub-group for further work up for alpha thalassaemias constitutes a biased sample.  It would really have been better from the perspective of trying to determine the prevalence of these conditions if the authors had centred their genetic testing on an unselected sample of women.  This is the approach they took for G6PD genotyping which therefore produced figures that were more understandable. The figures given for the prevalence of the various alpha thalassaemias are difficult to interpret and probably very misleading because of the way in which the patients were sampled. 8) For this reason, I would remove the rows regarding “suspected alpha thalasssaemia” from table 5 – the authors say later on that half of the sub-sample they tested were normal genetically, so this row will mislead the casual reader. HbCS and HbE are more legitimate as these have their own HPLC peaks. 9) Discussion, paragraph 2 seems a bit odd and comes rather out of the blue. This is the first mention of anthropology that I can find in the paper and the use of these IRDs as anthropological tools is put up and shot down in a single sentence! 10) Authors could be more clear that their estimate of G6PDd on the basis of their spot test result will be an underestimate, since homozygosity for less severe variants will not always be picked up (as shown by the outlier on Fig 2). 11) Discussion page 10 paragraph 2 left column. The authors say that all women with “Hb variants” are informed of the results and counseled that they may experience weakness etc in pregnancy.  I assume that this is not the case for “suspected alpha thalassaemia”? This would give rise to a great deal of unnecessary anxiety if half don’t actually have the condition anyway and in the case of the -3.7 and -4.2 deletions they are clinically silent when inherited alone.  The whole area of how to approach antenatal counseling in populations with a high prevalence of multiple conditions is highly complex and the discussion of this element could be tightened up a bit.  Minor 1) Though it’s an editorial decision, I would have assumed that since this is a UK based journal the spelling should be in UK English throughout. 2) Abstract Methods: Blood groups were “diagnosed” makes it sound as if these are a disease! I would change to “determined” or similar. 3) “resource rich countries” – preferred current term is “high-income countries” 4) Final paragraph of the introduction could probably be condensed and moved to join the methods section. I would replace by a short sentence summarizing the aims of the current study. 5) Please give the make and model of the HPLC machine used for the haemoglobin phenotyping.

NA,NA,Bancone,Germana,NA,"Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, Thailand",NA,"We thank the reviewer for his useful comments and suggestions. Below the answers to his questions.Major comments Q1) The background to the study is rationalized on the basis of the potential importance of inherited red cell disorders as causes and confounders of anaemia in pregnant women within the region.  The inclusion of data on ABO and Rhesus in this paper, though interesting, does not fit well within this rational framework.  Neither are particularly relevant to the main story. I would either drop those data or alter the rationale to justify their inclusion.  A1)Although the description of ABO and Rhesus blood groups was meant to add information on the genetic background of ethnic groups, we agree with the reviewer that it does not fit well with the framework of the manuscript. We have therefore decided to drop this part. Q2) The referencing could be improved throughout the introduction. For example, a reference for Lyonisation and G6PD activity could be added, and the third paragraph, which contains a lot of technical information, should be referenced along the way rather than through the bunching of 4 (slightly random) references at the end. A2) We have added more references in the introduction. The 4 references mentioned by the reviewer only concerned the selection by malaria of haemoglobinopathies. Q3) Introduction paragraph 3 could be tightened up. The first sentence is a bit confused: “..structural variants and deletional mutations on the hemoglobin …. chains” is a bit of a mixture of nomenclature more usually specific to either the protein or the gene.  The “deletional mutations” more commonly refer to the gene than the protein and probably more correctly should be referred to as “genetic deletions” rather than mutations (which more commonly relate to sequence changes than deletions).  Further down, “…97% of hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two beta chains” – the authors should clarify that they’re talking about ADULT haemoglobin (HbA).

It would be very helpful if the authors explained here on behalf of the non-expert what the G6PD spot test is designed to do and at what level of normal G6PD activity the test turns positive. A major issue with this test, as the authors acknowledge, is that it is a binary test that shows sufficient / deficient only. It is not designed to pick up heterozygotes and is only partially sensitive for homozygotes, depending on the genotype involved and the degree to which it perturbs G6PD production.  Some discussion of this in the methods section would help the non-expert reader. A4) We have revised the text to better explain the G6PD fluorescent spot test. Q5)  In the same section, the authors state that the quantitative test was conducted in “selected women”. It took me some digging to find that it was actually conducted in “a sub-set of sequentially recruited [and therefore “unselected”] women”. This could be better phrased at this point. A5) We agree with the reviewer that this part of the method was not phrased clearly and we have modified it. Q6) It would help the reader if the flow chart (Figure 1) could be amended to make the above more clear with regard to the quantitative test and the genotyping for both G6PD and other conditions.  A6) The Flow chart has been modified to exclude results of ABO and Rh blood groups and to clarify G6PD and Hb genotyping. Q7)  Methods; haemobloginopathies.  The authors used an HbA2 of <2.2 or <2.1% (depending on the method) to define “presumptive” carrier status for alpha-thalassaemia.  As the authors state later in the paper, this is neither a sensitive nor specific approach to the diagnosis of the alpha-thalassaemias overall.

The figures given for the prevalence of the various alpha thalassaemias are difficult to interpret and probably very misleading because of the way in which the patients were sampled. A7) We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue that we got wrong in the first version of the manuscript. At the time we started the screening we were not fully aware of the low specificity of the Hb typing for alpha-thalassaemia and one of our aims was to assess the diagnostic power of CE/HPLC for all hemoglobin variants. Nevertheless we agree that the way we presented the data was not appropriate and that the prevalence of alpha gene mutations in the subgroup of women with low HbA
2 is not representative of the general population. We have therefore modified the text and the Table. This has also allowed correcting the numbers of women with low HbA
2 tested by PCR which is 354 and not 374 as reported previously. Q8) For this reason, I would remove the rows regarding “suspected alpha thalasssaemia” from table 5 – the authors say later on that half of the sub-sample they tested were normal genetically, so this row will mislead the casual reader. HbCS and HbE are more legitimate as these have their own HPLC peaks. A8) This has been done. Q9) Discussion, paragraph 2 seems a bit odd and comes rather out of the blue. This is the first mention of anthropology that I can find in the paper and the use of these IRDs as anthropological tools is put up and shot down in a single sentence! A9) Since we have compared all these genetic markers between ethnic groups, one might argue that they could be used to estimate genetic differences between the ethnicities. We have removed this sentence together with the analysis of ABO/Rh blood groups. Q10) Authors could be more clear that their estimate of G6PDd on the basis of their spot test result will be an underestimate, since homozygosity for less severe variants will not always be picked up (as shown by the outlier on Fig 2). A10) We have added and clarified a few sentences to emphasize this point which is already well described in the literatures. With this analysis we wanted to concentrate the attention on the distribution of G6PD activities among heterozygous women which has not been studied extensively before. Q11) Discussion page 10 paragraph 2 left column. The authors say that all women with “Hb variants” are informed of the results and counseled that they may experience weakness etc in pregnancy.  I assume that this is not the case for “suspected alpha thalassaemia”? This would give rise to a great deal of unnecessary anxiety if half don’t actually have the condition anyway and in the case of the -3.7 and -4.2 deletions they are clinically silent when inherited alone.  The whole area of how to approach antenatal counseling in populations with a high prevalence of multiple conditions is highly complex and the discussion of this element could be tightened up a bit.    A11) It is very difficult to carry on a proper ante-natal screening and counseling in our setting and we are fully aware of the limitations of our approach. At the beginning all women diagnosed with abnormal Hb were counseled. As explained already in A7 the first aim for genotyping subjects with low %HbA
2 was to rule out alpha thalassaemia carriage; when genotyping became available and the results showed that half of women did not have mutations on the alpha genes and another 40% were silent carriers, we modified the counseling accordingly. We are aware the discussion is quite long but we also wanted to touch on the several aspects that make this setting peculiar.Minor 1) Though it’s an editorial decision, I would have assumed that since this is a UK based journal the spelling should be in UK English throughout. We agree and have changed the spelling to UK English; more than an editorial choice, the first author is an Italian who has a relaxed approach towards spelling.  2) Abstract Methods: Blood groups were “diagnosed” makes it sound as if these are a disease! I would change to “determined” or similar. We have cut this part. 3) “resource rich countries” – preferred current term is “high-income countries” This has been changed 4) Final paragraph of the introduction could probably be condensed and moved to join the methods section.

et al. is a very well written report of a sound investigation about biomarkers to differentiate bacterial encephalitis from cerebral malaria in children. The findings of this study, set keystones in the research agenda to develop a so needed point-of-care test for pediatric encephalitis in Africa. We have two major comments and some minor ones.MajorThe study was conducted with samples collected during 9 years. During these years, were samples from only 59 patients collected and archived? Given the importance of selection bias in biomarker studies, it would be important for the authors to provide details of the criteria used to select patients/samples for this study. Perhaps they could also provide a flowchart of enrollment in the supplementary material.The authors may want to provide minimal details of the collection and storage of their study samples, since Mass Spec proteomics can be very sensitive to details in the collection process including elapsed time to centrifuge and refrigerate samples. If not many details are known, given the age of these samples, it would be helpful to add to the discussion a limitation specifying that some proteins could have been degraded and thus, could not be properly quantified. To better understand the importance of selection bias to the author’s results, it would also be helpful to see a distribution of samples by the year they were collected. Hopefully, it can be shown that bacteria samples were collected contemporaneous to malaria samples.The authors state that proteins with more than 50% of samples missing quantification were excluded from the analysis but those that could be quantified in up to 50% of samples a value set to 0 when they could not be quantified. That is fine but it would be helpful to know what was the percent of samples that could not be quantified in each of the two comparison groups for the most important markers (perhaps those included in Table S2). Have the authors considered that an alternative explanation for the non-quantification was that the samples were degraded?  Minor  
Given the importance of the case classification criteria in this study, the authors may want to provide a few more details of the non-ABM group. They were classified as cerebral malaria but how strong was the evidence of the presence of cerebral malaria in this group? Could they have viral encephalitis, for instance, or a non-detected ABM? Could the authors provide their rational to state that this group represented patients with CM? Regardless of the presence of CM in the group without ABM, the results of the study are relevant since they show biomarkers that identified ABM and non-ABM (or unlikely ABM) patients.The authors may want to include in Table 3, the optimal cut-off value of the proteins that achieve the reported sensitivity, specificity. It would also be helpful for the top 10 or so proteins to see the boxplots comparing the two diagnosis groups to have a better sense of the variability.The authors may want to reconsider and exclude the ROC curve from Figure 4. The curve of an AUC-ROC of approximately 1 is not very illustrative. Also, although the actual accuracy of the identified proteins is probably very high, the AUC-ROC estimated by the authors was probably influenced by the fact that proteins were selected and had their accuracy estimated in the same samples. The curve in this paper is probably giving more weight to the estimated accuracy than it would be necessary.We have a few statistical suggestions for a future study conducted by the authors. However, the authors shall feel free to ignore those suggestions in this study. These different analysis would be unlikely to change conclusions and we believe the results of the study shall be made public and not wait for any additional analysis. The suggestions are: a) Wilcoxon and t-tests assuming equal variances were used to compare protein in the two comparison groups. Often the variance of proteins is very different across the two groups and none of these two tests are adequate when the variances vary across comparison groups. b) If the number of samples with zeros were substantial, a more appropriate approach would be using Zero inflated or Zero truncated models to compare proteins. c) In the future, the authors may want to explore using multiple imputation if missingness is substantial d) In the future the authors may want to explore additional feature selection procedures. Random forests are excellent algorithms to create classification signatures but may not be the most appropriate algorithm to select markers. Moreover, conducting a few different algorithms and evaluating consensus may help to decrease a bit the impact of overfitting in each one of these algorithms. e) In future studies the authors may explore using re-sampling to estimate accuracy, for instance, using cross-validation. That may help to discount the overestimation in accuracy that occurs when there is neither a validation nor a test set.We could not find any “phenotype” or metadata associated with the protein data.

I do not consider any action is necessary to address this comment since the authors made available what nearly all investigators do.Alternative explanations for the extremely high estimated AUC-ROC could be inserted in the discussion, such as issues with sample storage and selection that could have differentially affected some proteins (that have different degradation rates), and the impact of misclassification of patients in the CM group.My understanding is that the study used a label-free Mass Spec. To prevent problems with the Mass Spec community, the authors may want to add a comment to the discussion about limitations of the technology used as opposed to a labelled quantitative approach.

During these years, were samples from only 59 patients collected and archived? Given the importance of selection bias in biomarker studies, it would be important for the authors to provide details of the criteria used to select patients/samples for this study. Perhaps they could also provide a flowchart of enrollment in the supplementary material.We provide below bar plots of sample distribution per year. This was a discovery study for biomarkers and we randomly selected samples that had left over CSF samples and fitting study inclusion. We selected samples from a database of approximately 3,420 CSF samples that includes ABM, CM, and unknown aetiology as well as others. Since the proteomics approach used was label free protein quantification, the number of sample that could be used for the discovery study was limited. The study used samples collected over 9 years, although the distribution of these samples for CM was in a span of 4 years (2003 – 2006; Figure 1). For ABM, samples included mainly originated from the years (2002 – 2005 and 2007) (Figure 1.).    2. The authors may want to provide minimal details of the collection and storage of their study samples, since Mass Spec proteomics can be very sensitive to details in the collection process including elapsed time to centrifuge and refrigerate samples. If not many details are known, given the age of these samples, it would be helpful to add to the discussion a limitation specifying that some proteins could have been degraded and thus, could not be properly quantified.In the limitation section, the following statement has been included “Samples analyzed in this study were left over specimens following normal microbiology and chemistry laboratory procedures. There is lacking data for the samples on the time taken from collection during lumbar puncture to storage at -80°C and therefore there is possibility that proteome changes occurred during that period [1]”To better understand the importance of selection bias to the author’s results, it would also be helpful to see a distribution of samples by the year they were collected. Hopefully, it can be shown that bacteria samples were collected contemporaneous to malaria samples.Figure 1: Yearly distribution of ABM and CM samples included in the study3. The authors state that proteins with more than 50% of samples missing quantification were excluded from the analysis but those that could be quantified in up to 50% of samples a value set to 0 when they could not be quantified. That is fine but it would be helpful to know what was the percent of samples that could not be quantified in each of the two comparison groups for the most important markers (perhaps those included in Table S2). Have the authors considered that an alternative explanation for the non-quantification was that the samples were degraded?
The percentages of proteins quantified per group has been provided in Table S2 as requested.
In the limitation section, the following statement has been included “Samples analyzed in this study were left over specimens following normal microbiology and chemistry laboratory procedures. There is lacking data for the samples on the time taken from collection during lumbar puncture to storage at -80°C and therefore there is possibility that proteome changes occurred during that period [1]”.  Minor1. Given the importance of the case classification criteria in this study, the authors may want to provide a few more details of the non-ABM group. They were classified as cerebral malaria but how strong was the evidence of the presence of cerebral malaria in this group? Could they have viral encephalitis, for instance, or a non-detected ABM? Could the authors provide their rational to state that this group represented patients with CM? Regardless of the presence of CM in the group without ABM, the results of the study are relevant since they show biomarkers that identified ABM and non-ABM (or unlikely ABM) patients.The following text has been included in the limitation section. “Further, in endemic areas, the definition of CM is often challenging and CM is often over-diagnosed. The WHO definition of CM may misclassify up to 25% of cases [2] and its specificity is greatly improved by adding a clinical test for Malaria Retinopathy [3, 4]. However, Retinal changes specific to CM require specialist examination techniques, are difficult to examine in conscious children, and such data was not available in this study.”2. The authors may want to include in Table 3, the optimal cut-off value of the proteins that achieve the reported sensitivity, specificity. It would also be helpful for the top 10 or so proteins to see the boxplots comparing the two diagnosis groups to have a better sense of the variability.Bar plots have been generated as below for review purposesFigure 2: SPARCFigure 3: PRTN3Figure 4: PFN1Figure 5: MPOFigure 6: LTFFigure 7: LCP1Figure 8: CORO1AFigure 9: ACTN1Figure 10: SPARCL13. The authors may want to reconsider and exclude the ROC curve from Figure 4. The curve of an AUC-ROC of approximately 1 is not very illustrative. Also, although the actual accuracy of the identified proteins is probably very high, the AUC-ROC estimated by the authors was probably influenced by the fact that proteins were selected and had their accuracy estimated in the same samples. The curve in this paper is probably giving more weight to the estimated accuracy than it would be necessary.The AUR-ROC curve has been removed 4. We have a few statistical suggestions for a future study conducted by the authors. However, the authors shall feel free to ignore those suggestions in this study. These different analysis would be unlikely to change conclusions and we believe the results of the study shall be made public and not wait for any additional analysis. The suggestions are:a) Wilcoxon and t-tests assuming equal variances were used to compare protein in the two comparison groups. Often the variance of proteins is very different across the two groups and none of these two tests are adequate when the variances vary across comparison groups.b) If the number of samples with zeros were substantial, a more appropriate approach would be using Zero inflated or Zero truncated models to compare proteins.c) In the future, the authors may want to explore using multiple imputation if missingness is substantiald) In the future the authors may want to explore additional feature selection procedures. Random forests are excellent algorithms to create classification signatures but may not be the most appropriate algorithm to select markers. Moreover, conducting a few different algorithms and evaluating consensus may help to decrease a bit the impact of overfitting in each one of these algorithms.e) In future studies the authors may explore using re-sampling to estimate accuracy, for instance, using cross-validation. That may help to discount the overestimation in accuracy that occurs when there is neither a validation nor a test set.We will consider these suggestion which are very appropriate in our biomarker and related work. 5. We could not find any “phenotype” or metadata associated with the protein data. Without that, it would not be possible to reproduce the analysis presented in this paper. I do not consider any action is necessary to address this comment since the authors made available what nearly all investigators do.6. Alternative explanations for the extremely high estimated AUC-ROC could be inserted in the discussion, such as issues with sample storage and selection that could have differentially affected some proteins (that have different degradation rates), and the impact of misclassification of patients in the CM group.This has been addressed by excluding the AUC-ROC (Figure 4). We have included additional text in the limitation section of the discussion that address challenges (1) with the classification of CM and (2) sample storage. 7. My understanding is that the study used a label-free Mass Spec. To prevent problems with the Mass Spec community, the authors may want to add a comment to the discussion about limitations of the technology used as opposed to a labelled quantitative approach. This is not terribly relevant and it is fine if the authors choose to ignore this comment.We have included the following additional text in the limitation section “Label-free proteomics are cost-efficient, offer higher proteome coverage and a higher dynamic range.

et al are very interesting and very informative. However even if the manuscript and data presented are interesting, there are some minor concerns I will like the authors to take into consideration so that their work will be more efficient.Comments: 1) In the section Material and methods, it would certainly be interesting for authors to give an approximate size of the small cup they used to keep their mosquitoes after identification. This aspect could be important as the manuscript try to present some interesting condition for the rearing of
Anopheles funestus mosquito in the laboratory 2) In the text (mosquito rearing in the laboratory) authors speak about “Calavi”. I think they should give more details on what is Calavi. Is not easy for the reader with no information about this locality to know what Calavi is. 3- In the “mosquito rearing” section, it would have been interesting for authors to be precise that the total number of eggs reared was different or the same between the 3 types of water. 4- As the present manuscript is trying to describe an experimental design to improve the rearing of
Anopheles funestus in the laboratory, I think authors should ameliorate the quality of the pictures in figure 1. This will be helpful for someone who will try to reproduce what was done in the present study. Also it could be interesting for the reader if authors could give more details on “eggs incubation”  5- The two last sentences of the results section (Rearing yield of wild population of
An. funestus) seem to be contradictory. Indeed, on one side authors said “No adult mosquitoes were recorded from borehole water”, on another side they said “… for borehole water, rearing of larvae to adult stage took as long as 15 days. It’s a bit difficult for the reader to understand how authors did to estimate these 15 days to obtain adult from borehole water, when it’s said by authors that with this water no adult mosquitoes were recorded?

Anopheles funestus. This species is difficult to colonize in insectary and this has for long time prevented research on

Reconciling sequence traits of known PfEMP1 receptor binding phenotype, defined PfEMP1 domain types and DBL-tag annotation methods is important as despite advances in high throughput sequencing, analysis of DBLa-tag along with qPCR analysis still represent most efficient and precise detection of the polymorphic var genes expressed by parasites in patients. The paper presents the analyses in a set of intuitively easily understood graphs, - however PfMEP1 domain composition and nomenclature can easily become confusing. Most of my comments and suggestions relate to improvement and corrections of explanations towards a simpler and hopefully clearer presentation of the current knowledge and relevance of this study. One additional analysis regarding adding predicted ICAM1 binding PfEMP1 should be added to one of the figures. Specific comments: Although shown many times, it will be useful to have a very simple diagram showing PfEMP1 domain structure indicating the position of the DBLa-tag, the known hotspots of recombination at the DBLa-tag end, and mid var region. This will highlight the purpose and challenge of this whole exercise. Quote: “3) Analysis is further complicated by the high diversity of each domain subclass and lack of clear associations between specific adhesion phenotypes and classes of domains.” I would phrase this differently. Although many binding phenotypes have been proposed for iRBCs, well characterized interactions for PfEMP1 are more limited. In fact only few interactions are studied to the extent that these can be used to predict PfEMP1 function: CSA, CD36, EPCR and ICAM1. For these there is only a small uncertainly for determining ICAM1 binding domains. Binding to HABP1, PECAM1, IgM, etc is, as stated not clearly linked to specific domains or sequence traits. As parasite adhesion phenotypes cannot be investigated in vivo, ""specific adhesion phenotypes"" is defined from a combination of clear association of PfMEP1 domain type with binding to a specific receptor, as well as validation of this by iRBC binding assays; and thus observed iRBC binding to various receptors cannot be taken as a gold standard on its own. I suggest Correcting next paragraph to: Based on full-length sequences from seven laboratory isolates, each domain class was divided through global sequence alignment into further sub-classes (Rask
et al., 2010). For example, the DBLa domains were reclassified into 33 sub-domains (DBLa0.1 - 0.24, DBLa1.1 - 1.8 and DBLa2). I suggest changing references as: “
Ups E is associated exclusively with
var2CSA(Lavstsen
et al., 2003), which plays a central role in placental malaria (Reference Salanti et al J ex Med). Quote: “It was initially proposed that DCs may act as functional units. However, clearly defined functions have only been assigned at the level of individual domain sub-classes. Therefore, though common combinations of domains exist, it is unclear whether they represent functional units.” I agree with this. I would even suggest that it is clear that most domain cassettes, although useful to define molecular tools, does not appear to reflect functional units. However, I do not think the examples given does not elude clearly to this. In line with my comment above, I think it should be made clear that the binding phenotypes we understand well today, (EPCR; CD36 and ICAM1) all are associated with and fully contained within single domains. However, some subsets of these domains appear to have co-evolved - like ICAM1 binding (DBLb) in group A is always found in CIDRa1 (EPCR binding) variants, (co-evolution clearly seen within the DC13 context); whereas ICAM1-binding DBLb are rarely found in CIDRa1 (EPCR binding) containing DC8; and DBLb are not specifically associated with any Domain subclass when found in group B.  The comment of DBLb domains being targets of cross reactive antibodies seems irrelevant in this context and confusing here. Paragraph. “Clinical and laboratory studies have reported…..”. The DC8 and DC13 are useful for understanding how these variable genes can be probed and detected iin vivo. But given the limited usefulness of the DCs to describe known binding phenotypes, and their relation clinical outcome; And the recent studies of var expression (Those referenced, and the Mkumbaye et al IAI 2017, not included but should be) - which are in line with previous work as described in two paragraphs before; And to simplify for those new to the field – I think it would be best to use this paragraph to describe the consensus from these studies, that CIDRa1 is the only common trait of var genes whose expression is associated with malaria pathology; regardless of symptomology. And EPCR+IMCA1 but not CD36+icam1 is found more frequently in CM (lennartz et al 2017). These findings does not mean that future studies relying on DBLa tag is not useful or needed. M&M section: “Definition of block sharing groups” This is a more detailed (and required) description of the statement above on SB1, correct? Perhaps just refer back to this. It is unclear which part of the text refers to previous work or and which to the re-analysis performed here. Leave out the sentence: “and found that their expression was associated with cerebral malaria (Warimwe
et al., 2012).”. This is not relevant here. I think following concluding statement is not needed ,as the whole premise for the study is to compare classification methods,  - it is given or should already be stated that the sequences has evolved to under pressure to diversify in response to immune recognition, and to maintain structural fold to retain function: “This discordance between methods of classification, employing global and local sequence comparisons reflects a mode of diversification of
var sequences by
P. falciparum that we might speculate leads to impaired recognition and clearance of PfEMP1 antigens by the immune system. “Similar to group A-like sequences, DC8 sequences are associated with severe malaria (Bengtsson
et al., 2013; Bertin
et al., 2013; Lavstsen
et al., 2012; Rask
et al., 2010)……” The main point to iterate here should be that DC8s have CIDRa1 and a recombined B/A DBLa domain named DBLa2. The link to SM is part of this fact; . ie the presence of the CIDRa1 domain. I am not sure which part the Bengtsson et al 2013 reference plays here. Also, specify that DC8 is (the only known) a B/A recombination  - thus B from UPS to DBLa tag end, and A like in its DBLaS3 and downstream from there. This is important to understand, as the A vs B/C grouping is tied to the chromosomal localization of these genes which ensures that A does not normally recombine with B (otherwise lethal chromosomes will be formed). This is probably why the DC8 is the best conserved domain cassette, and why DBLa tag analysis is particularly difficult (and important) to apply for these genes. “Sequences with DC4 cassettes are reported to be associated with…..”. The ICAM1 prediction has been refined considerable in Lennartz et al 2017. The authors should color in sequences which contain group B DBLb5s show/predicted to bind ICAM1 and the DBLb3/1 domaains found and predicted to bind ICAM1 (Lennartz et al; + the IT4var07 shown in PMID: 26119044 & PMID: 27406562 ; which I believe was not included in Lennarz et al).  “Sequences with DC5 cassettes were from different…” ..As expected from this C terminal group A domain cassette - also previously described as not associated with N terminal seq features (Rask et al 2010). “However, such analyses will soon be replaced by methods such …” I disagree with this prediction. RNAseq may indeed prove useful if costs are reduced further to allow enough depth perform the required assembly of var genes, which are few and rare in RNA exptracted from blood in vivo; RNA seq may prove useful if the upcoming analysis of Sangers 1000 Pf genomes suggest so. Using MS analysis it is extraordinarily difficult to do de novo assembly of multiple rare polymorphic sequences in a patient sample, which is what is required to elude further to current knowledge. On the contrary I think this work lays the ground for a developing a much more cost effective var type prediction tool using DBLa tag expression analysis, once such a tool could be developed and validated from the ~1000 pf genomes to be released from Sanger.I have read this submission.

Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (

var, from non-laboratory stains it is typically only feasible to sample a very short tag region of about 125 amino acids from the relatively conserved
var DBLα domain. Therefore, most of the
var/PfEMP1 sequence variation currently available from the clinical setting consists of only this tag region. This region does not include most of the variable host endothelial binding sites that have been proposed in the literature, and which are potentially relevant to severe malaria disease. The careful mapping of the relationships between different
PfEMP1 classification schemes is therefore important for deciphering this protein’s multiple and variable binding functions, and the various disease manifestations that likely result as a consequence. Until it is possible to obtain the complete
var/
PfEMP1 sequences from large numbers of clinical isolates, this type of study is of useful for the progression of the field. The research methods appear to be of high quality, and the paper is clear and well-written. However, there are some typos and areas where the writing could be improved. Due to the complex nature of the topic I have included many detailed suggested edits below. The majority of the suggested changes are simply to improve the clarity of the manuscript - something that is important for readers from outside the community of scientists who study
var/
PfEMP1. 
This paper relies heavily on the results of Rask et al. 2010, which lay an extensive groundwork for
var/
PfEMP1 categorization. In that paper, the authors discuss the association between HB36 and cys4/cp4-6 sequences. The authors could maybe include a discussion of HB36 when they talk about predicting
upsA/CIDRa1.Throughout the manuscript, I believe PfEMP1 should be formatted with Pf in italics:
PfEMP1.The authors explain the diversity and mosaicism of
var genes as follows:  “due to recombination between
var genes on non-homologous chromosomes, the overall architecture of PfEMP1 encoded by different parasite genotypes is extremely diverse and sequences are mosaics of many semi-conserved sequence blocks”. I think this is slightly overstating our current knowledge of the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary and ecological dynamics shaping and maintaining var diversity. Why the variants have a mosaic nature is likely party due to ectopic recombination (recombination between
vars on non-homologous chromosomes), but also likely due to recombination between
vars at the
same genetic location within
homologous chromosomes.
Var genes surely recombine in a homologous manner at least as frequently as they recombine ectopically, and due to the diversity among different parasites even at a single
var locus, this more normal type of recombination is also likely to generate mosaicism. Another reason it is an overstatement/misstatement: if we were going to give a reason for why there is all the
var diversity, balancing selection is a much more direct explanation as opposed to non-homologous recombination. Balancing selection must be invoked to explain why so much
var diversity is maintained within the population. In my view at least, the question of the “extreme diversity” of the
var genes is not really addressed at all by just invoking the immediate genetic mechanisms generating the variants. Given the above, I recommend simply removing the following clause from the sentence: “due to recombination between
var genes on non-homologous chromosomes”, and replacing it with: “due to rapid recombination among
 var genes, and likely balancing selection” .The authors use the phrase “the infecting parasite population” twice near the end of the second paragraph of the introduction, and in both cases I believe they specifically mean the parasites within an single, individual host. I think this phrasing is more confusing than it needs to be. For any system with population-level dynamics occurring within organisms there is the possibility for confusion about the level of hierarchy the dynamics are operating on. Specifically, in this case, I think some readers may think the authors mean the population of infective parasites rather than only those parasites that exist simultaneously within a given host individual. Another possible source of confusion is that some readers may be familiar with the fact that the
var genes are expressed in a strictly mutually exclusive manner, and it may not be obvious that this does not translate to strict mutually exclusive expression at the level of the host individual (also I believe some early clinical results have contributed to some of this confusion). I suggest rephrasing as follows: “multiple
 var genes are expressed simultaneously within the infecting parasite population” could be changed to “while
var genes are expressed in a strictly mutually exclusive manner at the level of the individual cell, multiple
var genes are expressed simultaneously at the level of the infected host”; and “The range of
var genes expressed at any one time in the infecting parasite population” could be changed to “The range of
var genes expressed at any one time within a given host”.Starting with the third paragraph of the introduction I felt the structure of the manuscript begins to get a bit confusing. I had to work too hard as a reader to follow where they were going with the introduction, and why they were presenting this information in this order. I therefore suggest simplifying the writing in the third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of the introduction, and giving the reader a bit more of an explicit “road map” indicating how the paragraphs are connected and where they are taking us. Specific suggestions follow.A topic sentence could be added to the very beginning of the third paragraph: “The hope has been that it may be possible to identify a limited set of
PfEMP1 functional specializations, which may in turn clarify the disease process; however, it remains unclear which aspects of
var diversity are the most relevant for achieving this goal.”For simplicity, I suggest deleting “Based on full length sequences from seven laboratory isolates …”, adding the topic sentence suggested above, and changing the original first sentence of the paragraph (which would now be the second sentence of the paragraph) to the following: “All
PfEMP1 domain classes have been classified through global sequence alignment into a large number of highly refined and specific domain sub-classes (Rask et al., 2010).”The second sentence of the third paragraph of the Introduction is not a grammatically well-formed sentence. Also it mentions 33 sub-domains, which implies regions smaller than a domain, but I believe that is not what the authors mean. I believe they mean domain sub-classes (i.e., smaller, more refined categories of domains). I suggest changing the first part of the sentence to the following: “For example, the DBLα domain can be classified into 33 domain sub-classes….”I suggest rewriting the fourth paragraph as follows: “In addition to the refined domain classification schemes—which were based on the handful of sequenced laboratory strains for which we have complete
var sequences—various
broader classification methods have also been employed for the
var genes that use a sparser set of their sequence features.
PfEMP1 genes can be classified into just five broad functional and recombination groups based on sequence similarity of their upstream promoter regions (
ups) and chromosomal location. This classification partitions the sequences into groups A-E (citations).
UpsE is associated exclusively with
var2CSA, which plays a central role in placental malaria (citation).
UpsA var gene [note typo correction here] expression is associated with severe disease (citations) and rosetting (citations). Increased transcription of
upsB sequences have also been reported in cases of severe malaria (citation). And, while some research indicates that
upsC sequences are expressed at higher levels in asymptomatic cases (citations), it has also been reported that
upsC expression is associated with severe malaria (citation).”Choose a consistent notation for
ups groups (i.e. with or without italics, and with or without a space).Choose whether to say “subclasses/subclass” or “sub-classes/sub-class”. Both are used in the manuscript, and consistency is the important thing. I prefer the word without the hyphen, but its just personal preference.Again, mostly just for clarity, I suggest rewriting the fifth paragraph of the introduction as indicated below. I removed the “for example” and the numbering because, while the information is relevant, it is not clear to me that they are really
examples of the initial statement. “
PfEMP1 can also be described in terms of common configurations of different subclasses of domains. These common configurations are called “domain cassettes” (DCs) (Rask et al, 2010). Twenty-three
var DCs have been defined from full-length domain alignments of sequences from seven laboratory strains. It was initially proposed that DCs may act as functional units. However clearly defined functions have still only been assigned at the level of individual domain subclasses. Therefore, it remains unclear whether DCs represent functional units under natural selection, or whether they are just neutral artifacts of the recombinatoric diversification process. [Paragraph break here.] Research pertaining to DCs has revealed the following: Specific CIDRα1 domains, often found in the context of domain cassette 8 (DC8) and 13 (DC13), appear to bind EPCR (citation). Var genes containing DC8 cassettes seem to bind human endothelial cells from various organs, including—notably—those from brain endothelial cells (citations). DBLβ domains found within DC4 genes reportedly adhere to ICAM-1 and may be targets of broadly cross-reactive and adhesion-inhibitory IgG antibodies (citations). [Remove paragraph break that is currently here.] Clinical and laboratory studies have reported associations between DCs....”Page 3, second column, fifth line from the bottom: I would remove the word “respectively”.Page 4, first column, first paragraph: “by simply partitioning tags to those with and those without two cysteins” does not make grammatical sense, and it implies 2 versus 0 cysteins, which I believe is not what the authors mean. This could be changed to: “by simply partitioning tags by whether they contain two cysteins or some other number of cysteins”.Page 4, first column, line 9: I would remove “Furthermore”.Page 4, first column: For clarity, I recommend changing the sentence “Furthermore, Lavstsen et al., 2012 have suggested that information on EPCR binding by CIDRα1 within DC8 and DC13 may be unavailable within the DBLα tag due to a recombination hotspot situated between the DBLα tag region and the CIDRα domain” to the following: “Lavstsen et al., 2012 have suggested that the DBLα domain tag may not be informative about whether its flanking CIDRα1 domain binds EPCR because there is a recombination hotspot situated between the DBLα tag region and the CIDRα1 domain” [also, note that I changed CIDRα to CIDRα1 since I thought that was likely a typo].When referring to a paper within a sentence (as opposed to the parenthetical manner at the end of a sentence) the authors sometimes use no parentheses: “Lavstsen et al., 2012 have suggested…” and other times use parentheses: “classification that was suggested by (Rask et al., 2010)”. The style should at least be consistent, and ideally also consistent with the journal’s formatting recommendations for this type of citation.At least in two places there is a weird comma after “
var” that does not appear to belong: Within the first paragraph of “Results and discussion”, and within the 6
th line up from the very end of the manuscript.Final line of the first paragraph of “Results and discussion”: I recommend changing “sensitivity, specificity analysis” to “sensitivity-specificity analysis”.For consistency and clarity, use italics for “ups” or spell it out and don’t use the abbreviation. For example, page 4, second column, 7
th line up from the bottom.I believe there is an error in the title of the section “DBLα sub-domains are not all homogeneous groups”. I believe it should read “DBLα domain subclasses are not all homogeneous groups”. A “sub-domain” and a domain “sub-class” are completely different things. The first is physically smaller than a domain, the second is a smaller category of a complete domain. As far as I can tell, everywhere the authors use the term “sub-domain” they actually mean “domain sub-class” (or equivalently “domain subclass”).First sentence of the section “DBLα sub-domains are not all homogeneous groups”: Grammatical errors. Insert “The” before “Domain classification that was suggested…”, and replace “were” with “was”.Page 5, second column: These two sentences feel pretty meaningless to me, plus it seems the meaning the authors are trying to convey is redundant with the sentences the precede and follow. Therefore I would just delete both of the sentences: “The domain classification used in (Rask et al., 2010) has therefore brought together distinct sequences within the same sequence classification. This suggests that the newly defined sub-domains do not always classify sequences into wholly genetically distinct groups.”I think “This discordance between methods of classification, employing global and local sequence comparisons…” would read more clearly as follows: “This discordance between methods of classification when employing global versus local sequence comparisons…”The above sentence continues by describing “a mode of diversification… that we might speculate leads to impaired recognition and clearance of PfEMP1 antigens by the immune system.” I think this sentence presents an interesting biological hypothesis that could be elaborated on more. To me it is not immediately obvious that the discordance should be interpreted in this biological manner. An alternative interpretation might be that some categorization methods are less informative about recombination patterns, or more noisy, for example. I simply find the hypothesis interesting and warranting of further discussion.Page 6, first column: I recommend changing: “recombination hotspot proposed to be situated 3’ of the DBLα tag region” to “recombination hotspot purportedly situated 3’ of the DBLα tag region”.Page 6, first column: I recommend changing: “DBLα tag region and parts of the genes encoding important cytoadhesive regions potentially limits the predictive information available with DBLα tag sequence” to “DBLα tag region and
 the parts of the
 gene encoding important cytoadhesive regions potentially limits the predictive information available with
 the DBLα tag sequence”.Page 6, first column: I recommend adding a colon to “multiple cys/PoLV groups CP2, CP3 and CP4” so it reads “multiple cys/PoLV groups: CP2, CP3 and CP4”.

The residency sets out to ‘explore, challenge and shape perceptions and understanding of dementias through science and the creative arts’. They bring together scientists, clinicians, artists, and experts in communicating with the public in order to take this forward.  They are the second group to occupy the Hub and it seems from this account that they are building on the work of Felicity Callard and her team who were the first occupants of the space with the ‘Hubbub’ project. They draw upon Callard’s reflections on the essential messiness of the interdisciplinary process and also on questions of what ‘outputs’ from such research, carried out in a public space, might look like. The language used of the interdisciplinary process is striking: ‘troubling middle ground’, building on the ‘discomfort’ of individuals in this conflicted, collaborative space. Such language was apparent at the Hub workshop that is mentioned in the paper. Some attending that event even went so far as to speak about ‘fear’, and the ‘danger’ inherent to interdisciplinary working. I wonder how accurate this language is about what is actually going on in this space? I sense that researchers would not willingly submit themselves to being fearful or troubled. What seems more accurately to represent what it feels like to do genuine interdisciplinary work is the sense of excitement generated by the creative tension of being in dynamic conversation about a topic of common interest with others from widely different perspectives. This feels positive and thrilling – good reasons why people want to do it! The team describe spending the first three months of their residency developing their protocol, making use of the space and the opportunity for time to actually work together. Part of this process involved facilitation. My own experience in interdisciplinary work is that good facilitation throughout the process enables a positive, dynamic space to be created within which the team feel supported and, indeed, safe.  Interdisciplinary process is one key element of the residency, and I look forward to further reflections on how this evolves. Another element is engagement. The project essentially involves dynamic interaction between the arts, scientists and people with dementia. It was clear in the authors description of their ‘people and perceptions’ theme how they were to study dementia sufferers’ responses to art but it was less clear if and how they were exploring creative art’s response to dementia. This may emerge as the team start to develop their public engagement, but it would be interesting to see a genuine process of two-way engagement developing.  The residency protocol involves a second theme that I found very exciting: ‘in the moment’. This is an inspired idea, working with the notion that people with dementia often do live ‘in the moment’, and that should not be seen as a restriction but something to build on creatively. This reflects the aims of the residency to shift ideas about dementia signifying the end of life preceded by social death. Rather, in keeping with many chronic diseases, people live on with this problem and want to live well. I much look forward to seeing how this part of the research develops. As well as this crucial aim in relation to public consciousness, the Hub team recognise the potential of their project to take research into of the role of arts in health and wellbeing to an evidential level that will at last provide some basis for the efficacy that so many of us have observed in practice. Here they are asking some critical questions, especially ‘how long do benefits last’? Arts interventions in health care have so often been piecemeal and researched in a fashion that provides tentative evidence for short time (in the moment) benefits. It will be a real contribution if this team can show what role arts-based interventions can have on enabling those with long term conditions to live more fulfilling lives.  In view of the emergent nature of the Created out of Mind team’s research protocol - appropriately in keeping with the spirit of the Hub space - it was no surprise that they came up against a problem with NHS Ethics approval. I applaud their initial instinct to include ‘all outputs (traditional research outputs and creative outputs) as data’ and it is a pity that approach did not succeed. It is important that projects in medical humanities challenge structures that obstruct research taking creative new directions, particularly in conditions that have proved refractory to traditional treatment approaches.  This is an exciting new project that has the potential to enhance the lived experience of dementia, but also to move forward interdisciplinary, engaged research and I look forward to hearing more.I have read this submission.

Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.13838.r27626,Arnold,Ken,NA,"1University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",approve,"For the last three or four years, something of a socio-intellectual experiment has been conducted at the top of Wellcome Collection on London’s Euston Rd. Called the Hub, a space has been set up for a cohort of grant holders (awarded up to £1m over two years) to probe their chosen topic through a porous interaction between research, museum culture, and public engagement. Calling themselves ‘Hubub’, the first incumbents explored the concept of rest and its opposites, particularly as manifest in contemporary urban society. The second group reporting here (Created out of Mind) are interested in applying bifocal lenses of art and science to deepen our understanding of dementia, as well as to challenge commonly held perceptions about the condition. Around a third of their way down a carefully crafted path, this paper presents something of an interim posting about their journey thus far. An introductory section about the subject leaves us in no doubt of its critical importance. Few aspects of our aging societies are not having to grapple with the effects of this increasingly prevalent condition, made all the more challenging because of the shift in emphasis from simply ‘living longer’ to a more complicated desire of ‘living well’. Dementia then is one of our most pressing healthcare challenges, which can only be dealt with, Brotherhood
et al. argue, through the development of new thinking and methodologies. At the centre of their project is a clear and innovative proposition: “creative arts are a powerful vehicle for understanding, communicating and navigating this dramatic cultural shift.” Created out of Mind sets out to integrate insights from science and the creative arts, and suggests that the new comprehensions anticipated are likely to result in shifts in therapeutic approaches, and the development of new tools for understanding as well as communicating about these forms of mental ill-health. These developments might well also have practical and economic impacts. Furthermore, working in the opposite direction, this ambitious project also holds out the promise of unlocking more general learning “about art, consciousness and the brain from the experiences [but also the brains] of people with dementia”. Novel ways of examining how people respond to art through the senses, and how they participate in creative arts and explore cultural spaces are being developed. To this end, they outline two broad thematic strands of enquiry. The list of sub-topics and proposed investigative methods gathered under each are ambitious, verging on daunting. The
People and Perceptions strand aims to “capture the narratives, questions, emotions and experiences” of people with dementia and reflect on their representation in different media. Empirical material will be amassed by delving into the Wellcome library’s collections; through the application of Natural Language Processing techniques; by collecting relevant metaphors used in visual as well as textual forms; and by interviewing and observing the work of care-staff, focussing particularly on the language they use and the potential implications of using art in this relationship. Alongside that, the
In the Moment strand seeks broadly to measure dementia patients’ responses to participating in the arts, initially by surveying and compiling findings from existing studies processed through meta-analysis. Additional, more focused, studies will include the examination of: the physiological effects of participating in choral singing; modes of navigating real-world cultural environments; colour preferences both in virtual and real environments; and the impact of museum material – i.e. objects. Much of this study aims deftly to combine experiential and experimental examinations, where possible, turning the public venue (Wellcome Collection) into a sort of real-life laboratory. A third layer to the project (
Methodology gap) involves rather fewer projects focused more on the interdisciplinary research process itself than directly on the core research questions. As the paper’s title makes clear the concern here is to describe and reflect on the projects preparatory planning frameworks. We will have to wait a while for the presentation of even initial findings, and that is tantalising. In the meantime, we learn how “individuals who have received a diagnosis of dementia, carers and their closest relatives” are involved in the project as far more than just subject participants. Questions about how to balance classically ‘objective’ scientific studies with other more ‘subjective experiments’ involving patients investigated in closer-to-real environments are touched on. And so too are broader philosophical questions about consciousness (our experience of ourselves ‘in the moment’) and our shifting expectations of health, disease and creativity. Though necessarily restricted to the preparatory and aspirational, the material is nevertheless presented in a clear, honest and thoughtful manner. One particularly well-made methodological point distinguishes the need for a ‘searching’ phase prior to any research. This is a crucial but distinctly under-investigated or articulated process during which hypotheses emerge. Where actually do those hunches, itches, and puzzles come from and how are they developed? And can a project where art (typically imagined as an organically evolving exploration) intermingles with science (traditionally described in terms of executing a pre-determined set of aims, procedures and analyses) across a ‘methodology gap’ provide some insight here? This is decidedly a paper that asks questions rather than answering them; but it is striking here that the concept of curation seems particularly useful. Most of all, this is a paper that gets us to think in close proximity about how a substantial piece of self-consciously interdisciplinary work is actually undertaken. It includes two diagrams, which even when expanded to full screen, still present a dizzying array of intricate inter-connections between sub-themes and discrete packages of work. Those who have been involved in this type of project (one that has gained significant traction in the last decade or two) will recognise in them the almost overwhelming complexity of what is being attempted: laboratory habits applied to ex-laboratory conditions, efforts to make qualitative and quantitative evidence square up to each other; an eagerness for human subjects and experiences not to be taken for granted or explained away; and an urgent need to be as interested in processes as in goal-driven products. As well as a spirited and impressive statement of intent, we are also given insight into how initial challenges have been dealt with. So underlying tensions are hinted at, ones which highlight ways that “different individuals and institutions expect to be contracted to a large project”, as well as a political dimension to how disciplines relate to each other, both of which can result in new creative insights. Even more tellingly, the difficult process of obtaining approval from the Queen Square NHS Research Ethics Committee is outlined – their initial rejection coming as a ‘surprise’. Research governance protocols are, however, established to maintain standards and minimise risks, so maybe this initial response is itself a measure of the innovations being attempted here. They also elicit from Brotherhood
et al. the productive suggestion of employing a more collaborative model for making submissions to such a body. But ultimately, like the anticipated positive effects of using art with dementia patients under investigation, the new ways of thinking and working that this group are employing have not quite yet landed. They know the importance of genuinely collaborative practices and the potential significance that pursuing them in a shared space that allows social proximity between lines of artistic and academic enquiry as well as lived experiences of dementia; but they aren’t yet able to demonstrate that. We can anticipate proof of new insights about the role of art in dealing with dementia and of the value of interdisciplinary research practices arriving together further down the line.I have read this submission.

Many cancer-associated mutations truncate the encoded PALB2 protein to varying degrees, disrupting its function in the repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination. This interesting paper builds on previous work from Dr. Esashi’s laboratory to characterize the functional impact of two mis-sense mutations (T413S and S417Y) altering residues in a PALB2 region (chromatin association motif, or ChAM) previously reported to promote nucleosome interaction. The authors find that while ChAM fragments bearing the T413S or S417Y mutations exhibit sharply reduced chromatin interaction, full-length PALB2 mutants containing T413S or S417Y still retained a significant proportion of their chromatin-interacting ability, with PALB2 T413S being more severely affected. Consistent with this finding, PALB2 T413S when expressed in PALB2-mutant EUFA1341 cells sensitises them to the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin (CPT). In addition, PALB2 T213S (but not S417Y) reduces gamma-H2AX formation after DNA damage, although it has little effect on damage-induced RAD51 foci. The authors suggest that chromatin-bound PALB2 may have functions in the signalling of damage-induced stress distinct from roles in RAD51 recruitment, and that disruption of such functions may account for cancer promotion by mutations affecting the ChAM. The experiment shown in Figure 3A/B is not easy to interpret. Figure 3A shows that FLAG-tagged PALB2 T413S and S417Y are expressed in significantly lower amounts than the FLAG-PALB2 wild-type protein in whole-cell extracts, and their degree of chromatin association appears proportional to the level of expression (as reflected in Figure 3B). Therefore, is the reduction in mutant PALB2 protein expression – most severe for the functionally compromised T413S mutant – responsible for both the reduced chromatin association and the observed cellular defects? In this regard, the authors’ finding that GFP-tagged T413S or S417Y ChAM fragments exhibit little detectable chromatin association (Figure 2B), whereas full-length PALB2 mutants containing the same mutations retain significant chromatin binding (Figure 3A) is intriguingly unexplained. The authors make the interesting point that the PALB2 S417Y variant, which has little functional effect in their studies apart from reduced protein expression, has been found in the germline of cancer patients as well as healthy individuals. While it is possible,  as the authors suggest, that this variant represents a low-penetrance cancer gene, it may also represent a neutral variant (particularly if it affects only one of the two PALB2 germline alleles). Finally, the authors raise the interesting possibility that the PALB2 T413S mutant, identified as a somatic mutation in a single patient with lung cancer, may promote carcinogenesis and resistance to drugs like CPT. However, it was not clear from the accessible sequencing data whether the PALB2 T413S mutation affected one or both PALB2 gene copies in this patient’s sample. Should a functional wild-type copy of PALB2 be retained in this patient’s tumour, experiments showing that the PALB2 T413S mutant can act as a “dominant negative” even when wild-type PALB2 protein is present would strengthen the authors’ conjectures regarding pathogenic impact. This issue should ideally be explained and discussed, in case there are potential limitations to the authors’ conclusions regarding the clinical significance of their findings.I have read this submission.

The authors identified two mutations T413S and S417Y that exhibited defects in chromatin binding when expressed in HEK293T cells with only the former defective in chromatin binding in EUFA13141. Interestingly the T413S mutation has been found in a single case of small cell lung cancer. While expression of the PALB2 T413S mutant in EUFA13141 sensitized these cells to treatment with camptothecin, localization of RAD51 to sites of DNA damage was near normal. Unexpectedly, gH2AX foci in these cells was reduced compared to cells expressing wild type PALB2. The authors conclude that PALB2 that is impaired for chromatin binding is compromised for DNA damage signalling while seemingly proficient in the recruitment of downstream repair proteins. They propose that chromatin binding is required for DNA damage signalling, which might impact on the ability of cancer cells to respond to treatment with the therapeutic agent camptothecin. This study is a well presented and interesting study describing a functional requirement for the chromatin association motif of PALB2. It demonstrates clearly that mutations in the ChAM that reduce retention of PALB2 on chromatin have an impact on the DNA damage response. What is less clear is why? At the current time the investigation of ChAM mutants on the DDR is limited. It is clear that expression of T413S causes sensitization to camptothecin but this was not reflected in decreased RAD51 recruitment or increased gH2AX foci. However these assays were performed at a single time point and the data does not reflect the kinetics of repair. Is RAD51 recruitment affected over time? Does the decrease in gH2AX foci reflect fewer collapsed replication forks or increased rate of dsb repair (albeit possibly a harmful form of repair leading to decreased survival)? These issues are not addressed and this might explain the difficulty in reconciling a defect in DDR signalling with apparently normal recruitment of downstream repair factors but impaired survival. Given that PALB2 has, through BRCA1 and BRCA2, been linked to homologous recombination repair it might have been useful to quantify levels of HR and investigate sensitivity to Parp inhibitors.

PALB2 missense mutations in disrupting its protein interactions with complex members BRCA1 and BRCA2 is well-established, the role of missense mutations in perturbing PALB2 chromatin-binding function and its contribution to tumorigenesis is unknown. These potentially high-impact mutations were identified by mining the public cancer mutation database, COSMIC, and the literature. The fifteen identified missense mutations in the chromatin-association motif were introduced into HEK293T cells, and two mutations (T413S and S417Y) were found to have impaired chromatin binding, one of which is found to be mutated in a single case of SCLC (T413S).

PALB2 T413S-expressing cells are more sensitized to camptothecin treatment, and display reduced levels of g-H2AX foci compared to cells expressing wild-type PALB2 and PALB2 S417Y while maintaining comparable levels of Rad51 foci. This suggests failure to efficiently activate DNA damage repair signalling while maintaining downstream effector recruitment. Overall, the authors propose a novel mechanism through which
PALB2 missense mutations could promote tumorigenesis by impairing its chromatin-binding ability, albeit found in a very limited number of tumours to date.Comments:The immunoblot in Figure 2B does not show consistent levels of histone H3 in the chromatin extracts. Although likely an artefact, a better example would strengthen the finding of decreased chromatin binding of GFP-ChAM fragments harbouring T413S and S417Y mutations.It appears that all of the mutants cause a reduction in steady-state PALB2 levels. I appreciate that this could be an artefact of stable cell line selection, but probably worth a comment nonetheless, given the possible relationship between PALB2 haploinsufficiency and disease.In Figure 4B, shouldn’t comparisons be made between cells expressing WT PALB2 and the ChAM-mutant PALB2 proteins, in addition to the PALB2-deficient empty vector? The comparison shown, with EV, suggests that T413S is interfering with the action of another effector protein, since it is more defective than cells lacking PALB2. Assuming that the difference between WT and T413S is statistically supported, the data also indicate that T413S is defective relative to WT.In the Discussion, the statement “While the exact role of ChAM in HDR remains to be elucidated” seems premature, given there is no evidence yet of an HDR defect in the mutants studied.“The link between SCLC and PALB2 mutations is unidentified to date, and our findings may have significant implications for understanding the development of this disease.” I would omit ‘significant’ given that the mutation seems to be a part of the minority in SCLC and its functional consequences are as of yet undefined.The PALB2 ChAM-null variant response to camptothecin would be a good comparison to include in Figures 3C and 3D.Scale bars should be added to the micrographs in Figure 4A.A couple of typos. Results section two header reads S417S instead of S417Y, and ‘cell lines’ should be singular in the following sentence: “To further verify the efficacy of the DNA stress response in each cell lines, we examined….”.We have read this submission.

Methodologically, I find the formulation of the requests for the free-text responses which are analysed, very interesting. Starting with asking the participants to “think about the single worst interaction you have had with a health professional about NES”, followed by the request to point out which category of health professional involved in the interaction in mind, and then another request to describe what happened during this encounter (“what you disliked about the interaction”) seems to me as a fruitful way to elicit memories and stories of a certain kind, that is here about really bad encounters with health professionals. This arrangement resembles William Labov’s classical study of narratives from the inner city (Labov, 1972)
1. However, I find the one-sided focus on negative experiences problematic especially since the focus is “the single worst interaction”. I do understand the authors wish to give the negative aspect space. But even if this is the most difficult part for people with NES, and what calls for improvement in the health care, a two-sided focus in the same article could offer a more nuanced picture. Another methodological problem I see, is that participants were recruited from online support groups only. This arrangement is practical for reaching people with a certain illness/diagnosis but also implies risks for biases. The authors discuss the limitation of their choice noting that people with NES who does not have access to Internet will be excluded. However, not everyone with a certain illness would like to join a support group. Additionally, although the presented analysis draws on written accounts and narratives (my interpretation) given as free-text responses, and even though the authors claim to analyse these “from a social-constructionist perspective”, they do not discuss other possible biases related to support groups as a kind of sub group of people with NES. Other studies using data from support groups (and similar groups) for other problems than NES have shown collective narrating and co-narrating as important aspects of the interaction in support groups (Bülow, 2004; Cain, 1991; Steffen, 1997)

4. Mutual sharing of information as well as mutual sharing of experiences in support groups could be reflected in the free-text responses. This as well as the possibility for more engaged and informed respondents might be interesting to discuss. The result, presented under six themes, offers a richness of citations from the collected data. In this part the character of data as accounts and narratives are pointed out using verbs such as the participants “describe”, “explain”, “report” etc. In the discussion, however there is sometimes a tendency of changing the narrated experiences into something else like “people with NES are held accountable for onset of the illness”. The use of the concept of stigma in the discussion is relevant and intelligible. Still, there are some gaps in the line of reasoning when tying different factors together and when the authors move from dealing with the participants’ recounted experiences and the author’s further interpretation of these. One example is the description of how constructions of stereotypes like “lazy, crazy, time-wasters and fakers” become the obvious consequence of when seizures are explained as “caused by psychological factors” and “labelled as having a psychogenic illness”. There are many illnesses which are thought to be caused of psychological factors like for instance mental illnesses in general. However, mental illnesses are not stigmatizing in relation to health professionals but in society generally speaking. The stigmatizing in relation to health professionals could be something of certain interest for the study of how people with NES experience encounters in health care contexts. As a social scientist interested in narratives about less visible illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome, burnout and similar contested illnesses, I wonder about the character of NES with visible symptoms resembling epilepsy for which there exists biomedical explanations and which are lacking for NES, and how this influence the encounters with health professionals. One possibility to elaborate this aspect is to consider the medical history about diagnoses like hysteria and how NES is different compared to less visible contested illnesses. The visibility of NES is mentioned in the conclusion but could be elaborated on. Finally, as this study shows that the participants “main (negative) experiences centre on blame and humiliation” maybe the analysis more obviously should be grounded on the free-text responses as accounts explaining the challenges encounters with health professionals implies for people with NES.I have read this submission.

We address the comments in turn below, removing some background text that did not require action.Pia H. Bülow, School of Health and Welfare, Jönköping University, Jönköping, Sweden   1) I find the one-sided focus on negative experiences problematic especially since the focus is “the single worst interaction”. I do understand the authors wish to give the negative aspect space. But even if this is the most difficult part for people with NES, and what calls for improvement in the health care, a two-sided focus in the same article could offer a more nuanced picture. This paper was borne out of a desire to address (anecdotally - as we, and the patients we talk to see it) one of the most troublesome aspects of living with medically unexplained seizures – poor quality healthcare encounters. To explore and draw attention to these facets we made a (very) conscious decision to only focus on negative encounters. As described in the introduction, there are many reports of people with NES who describe negative interactions as common and expected, but there is scant literature as to what they perceive unhelpful/ adverse about these encounters, and why these situations might occur. Hence, the reason for our focus. Notably, there is also a growing body of literature exploring the perspectives of health professionals, which suggests they find interactions with NES patients “tough”, “uncomfortable”, “challenging” and “frustrating”. Therefore, we thought the study focus apt. We agree a two-sided approach would offer a more nuanced picture of patients’ experiences. However, the volume of data (and our desire to explore this considerable depth and present a rich selection of quotes) and what we thought the most important priority (as described above) prevented this. We have, however, added a reference to a paper that incorporates other (“positive”) data: Lian, O.S. and C. Robson, Socially constructed and structurally conditioned conflicts in territories of medical uncertainty,
Social Theory & Health, (under review). 2) Another methodological problem I see, is that participants were recruited from online support groups only.

4. Mutual sharing of information as well as mutual sharing of experiences in support groups could be reflected in the free-text responses. This as well as the possibility for more engaged and informed respondents might be interesting to discuss. This is an interesting consideration. However, the supporting literature mentioned relates to ethnographic observation of regular (e.g. weekly) “in-person” meetings (each exploring a particular setting/context). Our data is taken from a survey advertised to members of 20 support groups, and participants were widely geographically distributed (albeit possibly connected via online avenues). We agree that a degree of co-construction/collective narration is possible, but given the research design probably sloping towards the minimal. We put a lot of thought into identifying limitations (with more now added). At 800+ words in length, we have dedicated much more text to this section than usually allowable in an article. In terms of possible biases related to support groups we do say that “… our population was self-selected as people with NES who have access to the Internet and are members of online support groups, and there might be important differences between our participants and others with the condition. A likely bias it that those who chose to participate in our study have experienced more, or more severe, negative medical interactions than those who did not”. 3) The result, presented under six themes, offers a richness of citations from the collected data. In this part the character of data as accounts and narratives are pointed out using verbs such as the participants “describe”, “explain”, “report” etc. In the discussion, however there is sometimes a tendency of changing the narrated experiences into something else like “people with NES are held accountable for onset of the illness”. Apologies, the wording in the discussion reflects analysing participant experiences according to the overarching narrative, but we agree this cannot be extrapolated to people with NES more generally. We have edited relevant text and included words such as “perceive”, “depict”, “relate”, “recount”, etc. 4) The use of the concept of stigma in the discussion is relevant and intelligible. Still, there are some gaps in the line of reasoning when tying different factors together and when the authors move from dealing with the participants’ recounted experiences and the author’s further interpretation of these. One example is the description of how constructions of stereotypes like “lazy, crazy, time-wasters and fakers” become the obvious consequence of when seizures are explained as “caused by psychological factors” and “labelled as having a psychogenic illness”. There are many illnesses which are thought to be caused of psychological factors like for instance mental illnesses in general. However, mental illnesses are not stigmatizing in relation to health professionals but in society generally speaking. The stigmatizing in relation to health professionals could be something of certain interest for the study of how people with NES experience encounters in health care contexts. It is interesting you mention this, as in the early rounds of data analysis I often posited questions such as: “would a health professional accuse a person with schizophrenia of “faking” … express contempt for them, if not – why not”? The difference, we believe, comes back to the psychogenic element (physical symptom(s) thought caused by psychological factors). Mental symptoms caused by psychological factors seem easier to accept. Mental illness might also be less stigmatising in health care contexts as it is an established area of practice. People with psychogenic conditions tend to fall through the cracks (in the case of NES: neurology and psychiatry). In relation to psychogenic conditions we tried to cover these angles in the text (e.g. Discussion, Loss of status): treated as though they have “no medical [physical] problem”, “empirical variability”, and “ … reinforced by systems that struggle to place psychogenic conditions; which fall into neither camp on which our medical knowledge, curricula, or health services are built”. Another interesting point to consider is that psychological symptoms caused by physical factors also appear palatable (in both medical and social spheres). Unfortunately, a fuller analysis and discussion is beyond the bounds of this paper (and will undoubtedly stray into the philosophical: see for example Dekkers and van Domburg, 2000), but could be usefully incorporated in future work. As a social scientist interested in narratives about less visible illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome, burnout and similar contested illnesses, I wonder about the character of NES with visible symptoms resembling epilepsy for which there exists biomedical explanations and which are lacking for NES, and how this influence the encounters with health professionals One possibility to elaborate this aspect is to consider the medical history about diagnoses like hysteria and how NES is different compared to less visible contested illnesses. The visibility of NES is mentioned in the conclusion but could be elaborated on. This ties into a point made by Prof. Dowrick (2b) - We have reflected on the possible similarities/differences between the negative experiences of people with NES and those reported by people with other MUPS, and have dedicated a paragraph to this in the Strengths and limitations section. Please also refer to our text above. Regarding the medical history of NES (hysteria with convulsions, catalepsy, etc.) we draw on this in the paper now referenced: Lian, O.S. and C. Robson, Socially constructed and structurally conditioned conflicts in territories of medical uncertainty,

It is an extremely valuable contribution to an existent but very limited literature describing the experience of living with NES. The authors utilize free-text responses to an anonymous web-based survey from 135 subjects who reported receiving a diagnosis of NES made by a health professional. Among 86 items on the survey, subjects were prompted to “think about the single worst interaction you have had with a health professional about NES” and to write about “what you disliked about the interaction.” Subjects’ responses to these prompts and to a more general question (“is there anything else you would like to tell us about your experiences”) formed the basis for the qualitative data. The authors then used a thematic discourse analysis approach to generate six key themes such as negative and disrespectful encounters, lack of knowledge and awareness, illegitimate patients, etc. The survey results and analysis are clinically relevant and important in that they give a detailed and very consistent picture of the substantial pain and humiliation experienced by persons with NES in their interactions with medical providers – especially neurologists and emergency medicine providers. The analysis also highlight specific behaviors and communication styles that contribute to patients’ suffering. As a practicing neurologist the quotations were frankly painful to read because they reflected the hurt inflicted by behaviors I have often witnessed or heard discussed and sometimes performed myself. Neurologists, emergency medicine physicians, and other healthcare providers and trainees can gain invaluable insight into their patients’ perspectives from this study and may concretely modify their actions and communication strategies as a result. Having said this, there are several methodological concerns that raise questions about the validity and interpretation of the data. I have marked particularly concerning issues with an asterisk. *1) The main inclusion criterion was having received a diagnosis of NES from a health professional. There was no requirement that subjects have a diagnosis of documented NES confirmed by video-EEG capture of typical events, with review by neurologists experienced in the diagnosis of epilepsy and NES, as per requirements published by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)
1. Studies demonstrate that experienced neurologists make errors in discriminating epileptic seizures from NES based on visual inspection of the seizure alone without EEG confirmation, and other medical providers have substantially lower discrimination for NES, approaching chance in some cases
2. Eighty-five percent of subjects in the study reported a “formal (certain or highly likely) diagnosis of NES” but it is not clear that these subjects were diagnosed in accordance with ILAE standards. 2) Subjects were recruited through advertisements to NES support groups to participate in an anonymous online survey. There was no verification that respondents actually met the limited inclusion criteria described above. The authors acknowledge this limitation. They argue “recent reviews suggest health data can be collected with equal or… better reliability in Web-based questionnaires compared to traditional approaches.” Citations should be given here. Additionally, the diagnosis of NES is notoriously complex and difficult, subject to confusion and error at many steps. As such there is a legitimate question as to how many subjects actually had NES. 3) Similarly there could be no verification of subjects’ reported experiences. While some of the reported interactions are very plausible, others sound like the subjects may be interpreting or elaborating dismissive but less dramatically offensive behavior on the part of a provider (“he laughed in my face at the diagnosis of FND,” “I can remember her just standing over me… shouting ‘get up you are wasting my time, why do I have to put up with patients like you’”). There is great value in these reports because they illustrate the subjects’ perceptions and suffering, but it’s questionable whether they should be interpreted literally. The authors generally discuss the responses as illustrations of patients’ perceptions but on occasion appear to interpret reports literally (“participants recount practitioner conduct that defies all ethical and professional obligations and standards; and which has not been previously reported in the literature to our knowledge”). 4) There is a (perhaps understandable) lack of attention to the motivations and subjective experiences of the providers involved in the reported interactions. Some of the most disturbing quotations describe emergency medicine (EM) physicians apparently physically torturing subjects, and then crowing that the subjects are “faking” when they respond to physical discomfort (“He stabbed my arms with a needle whilst I was paralyzed to prove I was faking…. He kept telling me I was faking”). The context behind such encounters is that EM physicians need to determine within 5 minutes whether a patient with ongoing seizure activity is in status epilepticus (a life-threatening condition which should be aggressively treated with potentially dangerous sedative medications, possibly leading to intubation and iatrogenic injury or death) or NES (which should not be treated with medications). Unlike neurologists in epilepsy monitoring units, EM physicians must usually make this determination without the aid of EEG monitoring. As a result they often resort to noxious stimuli (sternal rub, nailbed pressure) in an attempt to get an accurate measure of responsiveness. While stabbing a patient with a needle is almost certainly unnecessary (and a diagnosis of NES should not be equated with faking), such behavior is often motivated by concern for the patient’s life rather than a desire to trick the patient. It is invaluable for physicians to understand how patients perceive this behavior, but it also important for patients and researchers to understand the perceptions and motivations of healthcare providers. Increasing communication between patients and providers and between disciplines, as exemplified by this study, may aid in both goals. *5) The lack of a control group raises an important question: how different -- how much worse – were the experiences of the subjects in comparison to the experiences of patients with other chronic illnesses? Were researchers to prompt groups of patients with other chronic illnesses to think of their worst healthcare experiences, it seems likely that many would recount truly horrific experiences. A control group with a different chronic illness would add a great deal to the interpretation of the subjects’ responses, and failing that a direct comparison by the authors to similar web surveys of different patient groups would be helpful. *6) The respondents to the survey are very likely biased toward those with more negative experiences, whereas those without intense negative experiences would presumably have less motivation to complete a lengthy and uncompensated online survey. The authors appropriately identify this likely bias as a limitation. Overall, these concerns are largely addressable and the study provides very important insights into patients’ experience of NES and health provider behavior. I therefore approve this study with reservations.I have read this submission.

The authors generally discuss the responses as illustrations of patients’ perceptions but on occasion appear to interpret reports literally (“participants recount practitioner conduct that defies all ethical and professional obligations and standards; and which has not been previously reported in the literature to our knowledge”). We have added some text to the methods (analytical approach) section to clarify our position with regard to interpretation of participants’ reported experiences. Presented here for ease: “The purpose of the data analysis was to seek an interpretative understanding of participant’s stories (Weber, 1922), which means that they “hold truth in the sense that they allow us to understand reality from the point of view of the person expressing these comments” (De Maio, 2010, p.150). In line with this perspective, we do not question whether expressed experiences are right or wrong, good or bad”. Regarding the language used when interpreting participants texts, this ties into Pia Bülow’s comment, point three: so we address both together. The original wording in the discussion reflected analysing participant experiences according to their overarching narrative. We have edited relevant text and included words such as “perceive”, “depict”, “relate”, “recount”, etc. 4) There is a (perhaps understandable) lack of attention to the motivations and subjective experiences of the providers involved in the reported interactions. Some of the most disturbing quotations describe emergency medicine (EM) physicians apparently physically torturing subjects, and then crowing that the subjects are “faking” when they respond to physical discomfort (“He stabbed my arms with a needle whilst I was paralyzed to prove I was faking…. He kept telling me I was faking”). The context behind such encounters is that EM physicians need to determine within 5 minutes whether a patient with ongoing seizure activity is in status epilepticus (a life-threatening condition which should be aggressively treated with potentially dangerous sedative medications, possibly leading to intubation and iatrogenic injury or death) or NES (which should not be treated with medications). Unlike neurologists in epilepsy monitoring units, EM physicians must usually make this determination without the aid of EEG monitoring. As a result they often resort to noxious stimuli (sternal rub, nailbed pressure) in an attempt to get an accurate measure of responsiveness. While stabbing a patient with a needle is almost certainly unnecessary (and a diagnosis of NES should not be equated with faking), such behavior is often motivated by concern for the patient’s life rather than a desire to trick the patient. It is invaluable for physicians to understand how patients perceive this behavior, but it also important for patients and researchers to understand the perceptions and motivations of healthcare providers. Increasing communication between patients and providers and between disciplines, as exemplified by this study, may aid in both goals. We agree that EM staff are under a great deal of pressure to determine the nature of a seizure, and for very good reason. However, what is striking about our participants’ accounts in this context (as you picked up on) are the accompanied accusations of “faking” (and implied voluntary control). Indeed, the vast majority of related accounts include participants recalling being told they were “faking”. Notably, in our data some patients describe stimuli in acute contexts using ‘technical terms’, e.g. “sternum rub” and “pin prick test”; and appear aware of the need for and motivations behind these tests. What seems to agitate them is the accompanied accusations. There are then other accounts of ‘stimuli’ beyond the realm of medical necessity (“bent a pillow around my face”, “head hit”, etc.) As a side, we would also like to add that in terms of the extracts presented, we purposefully excluded some of the most dramatic to avoid appearing overly sensationalistic. So while we agree it is important that patients and researchers understand practitioner motivations in acute contexts (and we have added text to the discussion, bottom of “execution of disrespect section” to this affect), we believe the most important message here (for us to convey) is for health practitioners at the front line to reflect on the moral judgements they convey, and thoughtfully consider the potential consequences of their actions. In short, to do what is medically necessary but put an end to any moral blaming and accusations of “faking”. *5) The lack of a control group raises an important question: how different -- how much worse – were the experiences of the subjects in comparison to the experiences of patients with other chronic illnesses? Were researchers to prompt groups of patients with other chronic illnesses to think of their worst healthcare experiences, it seems likely that many would recount truly horrific experiences. A control group with a different chronic illness would add a great deal to the interpretation of the subjects’ responses, and failing that a direct comparison by the authors to similar web surveys of different patient groups would be helpful. This ties in with a comment made by Prof. Dowrick, and so we address both together. We have reflected on the possible similarities/differences between the negative experiences of people with NES and those reported by people with other MUPS, and have dedicated a paragraph to this in the Strengths and limitations section. We have now explicitly pointed out that the lack of a comparison group is a limitation of this study. *6) The respondents to the survey are very likely biased toward those with more negative experiences, whereas those without intense negative experiences would presumably have less motivation to complete a lengthy and uncompensated online survey. The authors appropriately identify this likely bias as a limitation.

The authors explore data provided by 135 respondents to an online survey about NES, focusing on responses to three question related to the respondent's 'single worst interaction' with a health professional. Taking a thematic discourse analytic approach, they identify six key themes, including lack of knowledge and respect, disregard of experience and patient-blaming, and conclude that these encounters are typified by negative normative judgements on the part of health professionals, leading to a sense of humiliation and stigma on the part of patients with NES.

There is one important aspect which potentially confounds the interpretation of the data. The authors refer to the possibilities of some contamination of samples and tissue culture reagents as a possible source of EHV-2 virus and PCR products in tendon cells and provide a good argument to discount these. However, one aspect is not fully considered in their justification of this potentially novel finding. There have been many published papers describing equine gammaherpes viruses in PBMC and several tissues/organs in both foals and adult horses. EHV-2 is ubiquitous in horses and virus and viral genes are commonly found. For example, Torfason et al.
1 described detection of EHV-2 and EHV-5 in PBMC and a selection of tissues in about 80% of the animals they examined using co-cultivation methods to demonstrate infectious replicating virus. EHV-2 is common in foals but these observations were also made in older horses on this occasion. As with other gammaherpes viruses, EHV-2 is known to be latent in B lymphocytes (Drummer et al.
2) and these latent viruses were re-activated and identified by co-cultivation methods. These and other findings strongly suggest that EHV-2 virus or cells containing EHV-2 genes would have been present in a high proportion of tissue samples taken from horses for this study. Many samples were from slaughterhouse materials but even so, it would have been very difficult to remove tendon tissues from horses without significant contamination by infected (or latently-infected) cells.  These possibilities should be discussed fully in the paper. It is possible also that cell-to-cell contact of infected PBMC or other donor cells with tenocytes is the route of infection of the latter in vivo. This would be perfectly acceptable as a method by which EHV-2 genes and virus were detected in cultured tenocytes. The fact that the authors detected virus in only 2 of the 13 samples might also be worthy of note, considering that this virus is so ubiquitous.   Do the authors know if the positive samples were from old or young horses? The considerations above do not detract from the findings that equine tendon cells may contain EHV-2 and that this might have implications for use of these cells therapeutically to treat tendinopathy. The contention is that the paper should discuss the findings in relation to published papers such as those indicated above and the potential likelihood of this finding not being unexpected.I have read this submission.

The finding that exogenous XBP1 can repress the splicing of endogenous XBP1 without repressing PERK is noteworthy and suggests ways that in future, manipulation of individual branches of the UPR pathway could be used to target protein misfolding in disease, or to harness the ER more efficiently for the production of recombinant proteins. The paper is clearly written and the interpretation of the results is sound, although there are some aspects of the work that should be followed up. In Figure 1 (lane 4), there appear to be weak protein bands induced at 75 kD and 100 kD that react with the XBP1 antisera. Since these bands do not appear in the non-induced lysates, they may be specific. It would be interesting, therefore, to determine XBP1 expression and antibody reactivity in CHO-S XB cells induced with doxycycline and then treated +/- ER stress. The authors state that “as the mechanism for PERK and Ire1 activation requires BiP dissociation it seems unlikely that the absence of Ire1activation is due to increased levels of BiP.” This assertion could be directly tested by examining what happens to BiP mRNA and protein levels in the overexpressing cells versus control cells (+/- ER stress). In Figure 4, the experiments have been performed only once and the results, whilst clear, cannot be analysed statistically and are therefore somewhat preliminary. I would like to see the experiments in Figure 4 repeated, including a loading/blotting control for Figure 4C.  In Figure 4A, the flow cytometry data suggesting that ER expansion has occurred in the CHOS-XB cells is indirect, as the intracellular distribution of the dye may be influenced by stress responses. Taking this work forward in the future, it will be important to quantitate ER expansion directly e.g. in an adherent cell line, where ER shape and size can be assessed by confocal or electron microscopy.I have read this submission.

The weak protein bands seen in figure 1 that have a slower modility than XBP1 are indeed only present in the induced sample and are identifed with the antibody as contaning XBP1. It has been show previously that XBP1 can be modified by SUMOylation so we presume that these additional protein bands are due to this modification. We include a sentence in the results to suggest this possibility.The differential effect of exogenously expressed XBP1 has now been tested by determining the effect of a range of tunicamycin concentrations on XBP1 splicing or PERK activation. This additional experiment indicates that Ire1 is activated and as sensitive to UPR inducers in the presence of exogenous XBP1 as in its absence, but its splicing activity is dramatically repressed. This results does not address the consequence of BiP dissociation from Ire1 or PERK directly but it clarifies that there is a supression of activity rather than activation. We have now carried out a repeat of Figure 4C with a loading control. (see ORF (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.Io/BGCDE;)We note the suggestion by the reviewer.

1. This UPR defends the cell by attenuating protein synthesis, enhancing ER chaperone levels and activity, and increasing ER-associated protein degradation. Three signalling pathways make up the UPR, each initiated by a separate ER stress sensor, IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6. These differ in their downstream signalling and in their kinetics of activation and deactivation

6. Unspliced XBP1 mRNA encodes an inactive protein, XBP1u, while spliced XBP1 mRNA encodes an active transcription factor, XBP1s.  XBP1s activates genes that increase ER chaperone expression and cause expansion of the ER. In the study of Chalmers
et al, cells were generated that express active XBP1s protein in response to treatment with doxycycline. This caused expansion of the ER, consistent with induction of the known gene expression programme of XBP1s. When forced to express exogenous XBP1s, these cells also showed reduced splicing of endogenous XBP1u when treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation commonly used to induce ER stress. In contrast, activation of PERK in response to ER stress-inducing agents (DTT, tunicamycin, or thapsigargin) appeared to remain unaffected. This is a well-written paper. The proposed direct feedback mechanism linking XBP1s to inhibition of XBP1u splicing would be an important finding if it could be demonstrated definitively; however, the current version of the paper leaves a second (less interesting) mechanism still to be excluded.Main concern The authors suggest that XBP1s selectively blocks splicing of endogenous XBP1u, and that this does not involve a simple generalised resistance of the ER to stress. The authors acknowledge the second possibility in their discussion, but dismiss it because
(i) PERK activation persists following induction of XBP1s and
(ii) PERK and IRE1α are known to share a similar mechanism of activation
7. However, differences in the sensitivity of IRE1α and PERK to ER stress could account for their observations. If PERK were to be more sensitive than IRE1α to ER stress, then induction of BiP (or any process downstream of XBP1s that ameliorates ER stress) could block activation of IRE1α while leaving PERK apparently unaffected. This would occur if the concentration of stressor used were to be above the threshold required to activate PERK but below that required to activate IRE1α. To address this, ranges of DTT, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin concentrations could be tested for their effects on IRE1α and PERK, in the presence and absence of overexpressed XBP1s. If a selective negative feedback mechanism exists linking XBP1s to the inhibition of XBP1u splicing, then the EC50s of these agents will increase only for the activation of IRE1α.Minor concerns It is unclear why the phosphorylation of IRE1α has not been measured. This would help determine at what stage XBP1s antagonizes IRE1α signaling.The kinetics of activation and deactivation of IRE1α and PERK differ significantly
3. Have these been examined in this system?Does expression of XBP1s inhibit the activity of an IRE1α cytosolic domain activated independently of ER stress, e.g. the IRE1 constructs described in refs

NA,NA,Bulleid,Neil,NA,"University of Glasgow, UK",NA,"The main concern of this reviewer was that the results could be explained if the sensitivity of Ire1 or PERK to UPR induction was different so that, at the concentrations we are using, there could be a differential effect. We carried out the experiment suggested by the reveiwer, i.e. a titration of the response to tunicamycin in the absence or presence of exogenous XBP1. We include the result as a new figure in our revised version (Figure 5). Interestingly the result demonstrates that the exogenous XBP1 suppresses Ire1 splicing activity but does not alter its sensitivity towards the inducer. The conclusion is that Ire1 can still be activated but its activity is in some way inhibited by the presence of exogenous XBP1. No effect was seen for PERK which showed the same sensitivity to the UPR inducer in the presence or absence of exogenous XBP1.The minor concerns of the reviewer can be addressed as follows:
We have tried several commercial antibodies to IRE1α but none recognise the hamster protein. We can indirectly conclude that Ire1α is activated from the splicing assays carried out but cannot assay its phosphorylation status.We have not carried out an analysis of the kinetics of activation or inactivation.  As our comparison is between the absence of presence of exogenous XBP1, we focused on the difference between the splicing activity towards endogenous XBP1 in this paper. We have not carried out the experiments with the cytosolic domains of Ire1α suggested by the reviewer.  We do know that in the absence of an exogenous agent to activate the UPR we still see a supression of XBP1 splicing in the presence of exogenous XBP1. This is likely due to a low level of ER stress that occurs even in the absence of external agents.

Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes from 3 geographically distinct regions of Kenya, with an emphasis on the structure (and to a lesser extent, function) of
Spiroplasma populations within infected hosts. This analysis is performed by 1) deep sequencing of 16s rRNA sequences from whole mosquitoes and mosquito ovaries, 2) PCR screening for
Spiroplasma specifically, and 3) observing the effect of
Spiroplasma infection on female reproductive biology (maternal transmission, fecundity, offspring sex ratio and egg to adult survival). This study, which provides further confirmation that
Spiroplasma is present in
An. gambiae, is an important contribution to our collective knowledge of this bacterium’s population structure within this prolific mosquito disease vector. I have a few questions/comments regarding the manuscript in its current form: The high-throughput experimental design and data representation is ambiguous in places.
In the Methods, I believe the authors are trying to say that they made 5 samples of ovary and whole organism DNA, each of which contained material from 10 mosquitoes. However, as written in the paper, this is difficult to understand.The authors indicate that they used whole mosquitoes “since endosymbionts are generally at highest density in ovaries but can also be found in high densities in other tissues.” If they were interested in characterizing the microbiota found outside of the ovaries, then it might have been a better idea to sequence the 16s rRNA from mosquito carcasses that had the ovaries removed. The Results indicate that only 2 of these 5 pools were sequenced, and only one from each location. This sample size is low (and the Western Kenya pool gave rise to low number of reads). I suspect this analysis was performed as a preliminary indicator of whether or not symbionts are present, and thus whether or not the authors should proceed with further analyses.Missing from the Methods is a description of how the 16s data analysis was performed.A final ambiguity involves the lack of information regarding microbiota tissue distribution. DNA was extracted from whole mosquitoes and ovaries. Were the whole mosquito and/or ovary specific libraries sequenced seperately? Is the 16s data provided from whole mosquito or ovary samples? If libraries from both sample types were sequenced, it would be interesting if the authors presented the data in a tissue specific manner so as to correlate bacterial diversity and abundance with the distinct tissues used to make the libraries.
 For all PCR assays, it would be nice to have more information regarding negative controls. To do so, the authors could have used mosquitoes that they know are
Spiroplasma negative. I say this because BLAST analysis of the
Rpob and
FtsZ primers used in this study revealed that they exhibit very high identity with these genes in other bacteria. Can the authors conclusively rule out non-specific amplification from bacterial members of the microbiota that are not
Spiroplasma?I have read this submission.

Maternally transmitted microbial symbionts are especially promising because many have evolved sophisticated strategies to spread through host populations and/or suppress interfere with insect parasites and pathogens. In this study, the authors report the discovery and initial characterization of a strain of Spiroplasma insolitum that infects Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. It occurs at low frequency in western and central Kenya. The authors establish infected isofemale lines in the lab, rear them for two generations, and show that offspring are infected as well (although transmission efficiency is often low). Mitochondrial sequence analysis suggests that horizontal transmission is pervasive. This is an important contribution to the study of mosquito symbiosis and it will be interesting to characterize this symbiont in greater detail. It would be useful to have more information about the establishment and rearing of the iso-female lines (this is not always clear), because it is a bit difficult to interpret the results on transmission to offspring. Were some or all offspring screened as eggs? Were some or all offspring reared individually? If offspring were reared in the same container as larvae, then it is possible that there was horizontal transmission from adult females, and then between larvae. It would be useful to rear infected and uninfected individuals together. If uninfected mosquitoes do not pick up the infection from infected ones, then vertical transmission may predominate.  Some other comments:
It would be useful to have a sentence explaining why Spiroplasma-infected mosquitoes were only kept in the lab for 2 generations.The fact that the strain is identical at all genes sequenced in the study to S. insolitum from insects from other orders also suggests predominantly horizontal transmission. It would also be useful to mention more clearly that a number of cultivable/horizontally transmitted Spiroplasma have been isolated from (non-anopheline) mosquitoes.In Figure 4, it would be useful to add arrows to indicate which F1 lines are the mothers of the F2.It would be useful to have more information about Figure 5. Was transmission to offspring measured in these Spiroplasma-infected females? Which mothers are these (connect to Figure 4? F1?)?Why were mosquitoes collected as larvae older than field-caught mosquitoes (second last page)?

The paper should be revised and written more carefully. There are incomplete sentences and also errors in graph (Figure 2, pie graph Mwea does not appear to be 14%).The methodology is poorly described. One example is that the rearing procedures after the mosquitoes were brought from field to laboratory were not described, and in this case are crucial. Another important point: How were the field mosquitoed treated during sample preparation for sequencing? Were the males used to cross with field collected females laboratory sterile mosquitoes, or they were infected too?Moreover the experimental design could be improved considerably: - The number of mosquitoes used in different analysis is still too low! Sample size needs to be higher. - Although authors say that they had pools with samples of 5 whole mosquitoes and samples of 5 mosquito ovaries, nothing more is done or said about the differences among the two pools. It would be interesting to also include male in the analysis, as well as compare different tissues (including midgut, ovaries, testis and accessory glands, for example). - Include sterile laboratory mosquitoes as controls. - Authors should compare results using cultivable and culture-independent methods. - Experiments performed to verify vertical transmission and sex ratio determination were performed with low number of mosquitoes, two F1 had really low number of offspring  and most of F1 produced no offspring. So, the conclusions to address those questions (maternal transmission and sex ratios) were made based on very few mosquitoes, that came from the low number of parental mosquitoes that were able to produce viable offspring. - Fecundity assays performed with low number of mosquitoes. Were those assays made with G0? How those results correlate with the data of Figure 4? - In Figure 5, instead of means, this type of data requires medians. - It is important to keep in mind that the relative abundance of Spiroplasma,, based on data that the authors had shown (with a low number of pools), is quite low, and the possibility that other bacteria play a role in fecundity and survival rate for example, cannot be ruled out. This was not addressed or discussed.In my opinion data provided and sample size are not enough to support the conclusions.Not clear why authors focused on
Spiroplasma, that has low relative abundance and prevalence in the areas and claim they might be good symbiont to protect mosquitoes from
Plasmodium. A lot needs to be done and better addressed.Discussion is still poor.

The authors studied the impact of pyocyanin on neutrophil survival using bacterial supernatants form WT and PPHD-deficient mutant.

This statement is not true, additional references should be included regarding the O2-modulation of bacteria virulence, adhesion, secretion, etc.

In vitro co-culture of neutrophils directly with pseudomonas species rapidly results in neutrophil loss. This is why we firstly explored the consequence of neutrophil culture with bacterial supernatants before undertaking in vivo experiments in which we were able to directly address the consequence of infection with the different strains of P. aeruginosa on neutrophil survival in a biological setting. Due to the ability of pseudomonas to induce neutrophil apoptosis, this is a difficult question to directly address.  We would however argue that it is the ability of Pseudomonas to evade the host response that is critical in defining the outcome of the infection challenge, a concept supported by the published literature (Usher et al. JI 2002; Allen et al. JI 2005; Prince et al. JI 2008) and our in vivo observations.We are sorry for any confusion caused, in the discussion we do actually state that “until recently, the possibility that oxygen may also regulate the bacterial pathogens has not been considered” and provide a number of references specific to Pseudomonas throughout the text that reference that capacity of hypoxia to alter pathogenicity (Scotti et al.

The study is described in a fairly clear way; however, aspects could be improved on to strengthen the article. Firstly, I would encourage the authors to clearly reference the Facebook and YouTube links explicitly with hyperlinks within the document if this is possible. The footage and images within these links clearly convey: the nature of the engagement; the participants and audiences involved in the activities; some of the challenges the authors and implementers encountered; and the sheer enjoyment of the participants in taking part in the activities. These are incredibly beautiful and striking images which bring the article alive and so are worth making the most of (assuming of course that the participants are happy for their images to be shared). There is a risk that readers may interpret the project as using a ‘deficit model’ of engagement, where educated researchers enter ‘illiterate’ communities to fill the knowledge gaps. Though the main aim of the activities described is explicitly stated as addressing health knowledge gaps related to Malaria control, I feel that more of an emphasis could be made of the close collaboration between researchers and community members required in implementing this project, drawing on existing local talent and knowledge, towards addressing goals of engagement/health promotion. This collaboration was especially evident in the videos. In relation to this, if the data-set included evidence of a strengthening relationship, mutual-understanding or trust between researchers and participants, then this would be worth including. There is some ambiguity about the overall aim of the engagement/research. The abstract states that the purpose of the project is to assess the feasibility of a drama project as a community engagement strategy. The description however, lacks an ethical argument as to why the authors selected health-promotion activities as a vehicle for engaging communities. Playing devil’s advocate, it could be argued that health promoting activities such as “using insecticide-treated bednets and repellents, etc.” rather than being the role of health researchers, is the work of the the Cambodian National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control (CNM), through their Malaria Elimination Action Framework (MEAF) 2016–2020. Since the discussion presents a case that this is an engagement project ‘integral to successful and ethical health-related research,’ more clarity is needed in arguing why conducting health-promotion activities addresses ethical goals of community engagement. For example, did the implementers feel that they were well placed to conduct these activities, given their knowledge of malaria, to conduct health promotion? Was it a form of addressing ‘justice’ and ‘beneficence’ in research through offering community members means of improving their health? Was the purpose of the engagement to strengthen community members understanding of Malaria control, in order to complement informed consent for a specific MORU study (addressing ‘respect for persons’)? Or was it a means of strengthening relationships between research host communities and researchers (there is some evidence of this – leaders felt that participation offered an opportunity to learn about the work of MORU)? … or was it a combination of all of these? I feel that using health-promotion as a means of engagement is entirely justifiable (see for example Participants in the CE and Consent Workshop (2013)
1 or (Nakibinge et al., 2009
2), but I think the ambiguity could be cleared with a short description/justification of why they are using it. In relation to the above paragraph it would be helpful to provide a clearer description of the Malaria Elimination Action Framework (MEAF) 2016–2020. Is this a guideline document, or a group of government interventions, or both? Is the Battambang Provincial Health Department responsible for implementing this framework? If so, what are they already doing on the ground? Does MORU have a “Malaria elimination’, or related study which this engagement project is part of, or is the project a stand-alone?

The genre of engagement seems appropriate for the population served, as backed by the evaluation.

This is relevant if they are assessing recall of the theatre script content and attributing the engaging methods of health promotion for people's ability to remember the key health messages. The number of participants is small and ideally they would have interviewed more villagers, and at different time points. The authors acknowledge this as a limitation to the study.

For the most part, the work is clearly and accurately presented, but important clarifications are required at certain points. It is emphasized throughout that drama is the key engagement strategy being evaluated. However, the VDAM community engagement approach (at each site) comprised of a 3-day workshop including art, music, village concerts and competitions, with a (participatory) drama performance taking place on the final evening. As far as I can understand, drama was not used in isolation in any of the participant villages. So using the term 'drama project' is questionable. The authors could perhaps consider another term that better reflects the multi-pronged nature of the community engagement approach taken.   The authors explain that the project took place between June and September 2016, and that the interviews and focus group discussions were conducted in July of that year. Details are provided about the groups who were included in these processes, and the number of respondents. Were all of the respondents from the same village? (i.e. are all responses based on a single 3-day workshop event?). It is important to know this as it will indicate which of the study areas are represented in the results and conclusions. (At several points in the paper, the authors refer to ‘the’ event or ‘the’ performance, which indicates that the results are indeed based on the implementation of a single workshop activity. Please do clarify if this was the case). It is explained that the project also included modern technologies such as drones to film the villages and social media to share photos and videos across the province. These elements of the engagement process do not inform the research findings described in the article. I was left wondering why this information was included in the paper, what the main purpose of this province wide dissemination was, and what the ethical implications of these disseminations approaches were. The average rate of event participation is calculated to be 66% across all the villages, and this statistic is highlighted in the paper abstract. The authors explain that a single 3-day workshop was held for each village, that there is appreciable variation in the size of the villages, and that the majority of villagers commute on foot, making it potentially difficult for residents of the largest villages to attend the drama events (due to walking distance). The suggestion that walking distance may explain lower participation rates in larger villages could be substantiated by a formal but simple analysis of population size versus percent attendance. A comment on the feasibility/practicality/value of implementing more than one workshop in the larger villages would be helpful, too.  I felt that certain parts of the results section (e.g. page 6 ‘Combining arts and science…’ and ‘Social relationships in Cambodia…’) would be more appropriately placed in the discussion.   Current literature In the discussion, the authors mention that - to their knowledge - ‘the current paper is the first assessment of using drama to engage ‘ the community’ for malaria control and elimination’. M Frishkopf and his colleagues have recently published research showing that a performing arts public health intervention in northern Ghana was effective to convey key messages about malaria transmission to local audiences (Frishkopf M. et al, 2016
1) Additional reference to growing international recognition of both the value and ethics of community engagement in health-related research could be included. (King KF et al., 2014
2. Wallerstein and Duran, 2010
3).  The key community engagement intervention strategy that is discussed in this paper is participatory drama. Drama is a visual method of engagement. Some reference to the value of working with participatory visual methods as a community engagement approach in public health and health research would add an important element to the current article (Mitchell and Sommer, 2016
4)Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others? On page 5, the authors explain that their sampling method was purposive and limited by practicalities, but. To enable replicability, it would have been helpful to be given a brief description of the process through which interview respondents and focus group members were selected.    The authors also explain that semi-structured interviews were done with various groups, including five professional actors one village malaria worker. The results section describes thematic key responses from different participant groups – especially the villagers - but there is no mention of responses from the actors or the VMWs. A complete understanding of the feasibility of the engagement strategy will only be gained through including the perspectives of all research respondents in the analysis.      The description of the drama workshops and performances indicates that the drama was partly developed before the village engagement activities began, and then further developed during the workshop. This further development included participation from teenagers and young people, at each site, by the incorporation of their personal stories and experiences. This process of drama development is a very important part of the methodology and approach to community engagement. I would suggest that a bit more detail is provided here as to the steps taken, for the purposes of replicability by others in the field. In the interest of the word count, this could perhaps be written in detail as supplementary material. The section describing the main storyline for the play is currently included in the results section (page 6). It does not describe the results of the data analysis, and would be more appropriately placed in the methods section. However, the storyline description is not necessary to the understanding of the project and could be left out entirely.  Are the conclusions drawn adequately and supported by the results? Seven themes were surfaced through analysis of the data generated by the interviews and focus group discussions. There is a large overlap between the areas explored in the interview guides and the resulting themes. This is not entirely surprising, given the small sample size in each respondent group, but it is worth noting as a study limitation.   The groups that participated in the interviews/focus group discussions, and the number of respondents in each of these groups, is described on page 5. For example, we know that there was 1 local health staff respondent and 1 village leader respondents. However, at several points in the results sections, the writing indicates that there were multiple respondents in these groups. (‘Staff from the local health authority felt…’, and ‘ Village leaders were interested because…’. The text needs to more accurately reflect the singular nature of these responses, and of the other interviewed groups that contained a single respondent.      I wonder if sustainability is a relevant theme to be discussed this paper, based on the results of the data analysis that are described. The actual responses cited in this section refer to better understanding about malaria elimination projects that were gained through the engagement approach, which would seem to fit under theme 3 (understanding and learning about malaria using drama). Also, increased willingness of villagers to do blood testing does not speak to the sustainability of the engagement approach that is being evaluated, but rather to its impact. I would suggest revisiting this section and thinking about which parts are results that could be included under other themes, and which parts could be moved to the methods or discussion sections.        The conclusions that are drawn are based on both the rates of participation in each village (averaging out at 66%) and the results from interviews and focus group sessions. In the section on data collection, the authors do acknowledge that their sampling was limited by practicalities, but the small sample size of each respondent group is a key limitation and this needs to be noted in the conclusion section.Additional Comments In the results section of the abstract, it is indicated that 'The event saw a very positive response...' Again this indicates that – even although the project included community engagement activities in 20 villages - the article is based on a single engagement event. If this is the case, readers should be made aware of this in the abstract. In the conclusion of the abstract, it is stated that 'the drama project was feasible in promoting awareness and understanding of malaria prevention and control'. This statement could be qualified by adding 'in this context' (i.e. rural settings in S.E. Asia). I would make the same suggestion for the final concluding statement in the paper. In the discussion, it would have been interesting to hear some of the authors reflections on the ethical considerations of using this specific approach to community engagement, having gained this important experience. For example, as far as I can see, approvals for the use of social media, filming and photography were only gained from the provincial authorities. Is this level of approval sufficient? If so, why is this considered to be the case? Did the project process foster expectations about the elimination of malaria in the district? If so, how were such expectations managed by the MORU team?     In the discussion, a sentence or two indicating the authors learning from using a professional, touring drama team as the lead performers in a participatory process would also have valuable. Page 3. The explanation of literacy rates needs to be clarified For example : The 2014 census indicated literacy rates to be 93% and 77% in urban and rural areas, respectively.  On page 5, the authors explain that approval for the main script, storyline and key messages was sought from provincial health authorities. Was approval for these things also sought, at any stage, from villagers, VMW or local health staff?  The authors explain that the average number of attendees at each village performance was 430. This is a large audience size for a community drama event. Were there any implications of this, for example background noise levels, or children running around? Were microphones/speakers used in this process? I wonder if this element of the drama engagement was explored through the interviews or focus groups. These are also important methodological details for the purposes of replicability.     Minor comments In five cases, the spelling/formatting of the village names differs between the map (Figure 1) and Table 1.     The ethical statement on page 5 is duplicated on page 8.   This interesting research article provides important insights into the possibilities and challenges for multi-pronged, creative community engagement strategies to contribute to malaria elimination in rural South East Asia. With a little more reference to directly resonant publications, greater attention to  grammar in some places, the repositioning of certain content, and the inclusion of ethical reflection, it will make an excellent and needed contribution to the community engagement in global health literature.I have read this submission.

The authors of this study evaluated indoor air pollution and the risk of pneumonia in adults. They showed no increased risk of pneumonia attributable to indoor air pollution exposure. This is a well conducted and very intensive study documenting pneumonia accurately (radiologically) and exposure (environmental monitoring) objectively. As with all studies there are limitations such as the case control design – although significant numbers were recruited, the evaluation of air pollution exposure was post event (pneumonia), and the number of confounders that need to be adjusted for.  What is striking is the absolute lack of effect OR 1 with 95% CI 0.99 – 1.01. It is unlikely that doing a prospective study with regular (pre event) air pollution monitoring, given the data presented would make any difference to the conclusion, and the short time between admission and subsequent air quality measurement precludes any real potential for significant differences in cooking behaviour before the event and after. What this study does highlight is the difference between children and adults – and that we can’t simply assume that the exposure and risks would be the same. Additionally the complex interactions of poverty, malnutrition, indoor air pollution, tobacco and alcohol require robust statistical methods. The univariate models showed effects of cooking with wood and odds of pneumonia to be 13. This was not evident in the HIV positive group – suggesting that HIV infection may play a far more significant role as a risk factor and the risk attributable to wood smoke does not significantly add to the high HIV risk. It is not possible by the nature of the study to evaluate the rate of pneumonia in the HIV negative vs. HIV positive groups for given exposure. It would be of value if the statistical community could evaluate such complex interactions/ confounders/ effect modifiers in such a cohort with newer tools, so that when we see a result such as this, which although plausible is a little unexpected, that we are certain that the lack of statistical effect is not due to ‘underpowered” statistical tools that can’t handle such complex and multifaceted interactions.I have read this submission.

The authors provide a clear summary of why better surveillance systems are required to tackle AMR in LMICs and the barriers to achieving this goal in this context.General comments Although the authors mention the need for population surveillance and collection of clinical data, this article mainly focuses on the need to strengthen laboratory capacity at local, regional and national level. In my view this provides only part of the answer, as we also need to embed systems for monitoring antibiotic usage (prescribed and over the counter) and for measuring treatment outcomes. This is particularly relevant in settings where microbiology laboratories are poorly resourced. For example, a clinical assessment of whether the patient got better might in some cases be more informative than drug susceptibility testing. The tables are a very useful tool to assess surveillance capacity. It would have been helpful to apply these criteria across each of the 3 countries presented to give a summary of the systems available in each setting. Whilst it makes sense to develop surveillance systems centered on hospitals, in the longer-term it would be helpful to include sentinel sites from community settings where the population attending may be systematically different from those who attend hospital (the authors allude to this in their manuscript).Introduction In the Introduction the authors cite cost as the major barrier to the establishment of an AMR surveillance system in high income countries. I think this is only part of the reason. Until recently AMR surveillance was not a high priority because the steady supply of new antibiotics meant that drug resistance did not really matter – you could simply use a different drug.Desk-based analysis and conceptual model It would be helpful if the authors provide a list of experts involved in developing the conceptual model. More information on a) which databases and resources were searched for articles and information and b) which references were used to derive the results. Examples were clarification is desirable include:
The finding by the authors that in Africa “… capacity is being developed …"" currently appears to be solely based on one extensive example from Ghana. Stating that capacity is developed based on 1/47 states possibly overstates the true development.No numbers were provided for South-East Asia, although numerical summaries are available for Africa. Numbers were provided for Africa, but not for South-East Asia. Assuming that both are based on the WHO report (in the absence of other reference except for a workshop report from Cambodia), it is unclear why no numbers can be provided for South-East Asia to facilitate comparison.It is unclear what data was used to identify the listed “emerging themes”. Some of the points seem to draw on the case studies, e.g. Training: “Well-trained staff are likely to move elsewhere for better salaries, …” which is featured in the case studies for Malawi and Ethiopia.Further, it is unclear how model options were identified and summarised. Are they theory based (no reference is given) or are they based on observation of models in the countries of interest? Are they exhaustive?  Analytical framework It is currently unclear how the functions, sub-functions and activities needed for AMR surveillance were identified? It would be helpful to include some more detail on how this was developed.Costs No discussion is included on how representative and generalizable costs based on a highly functioning site in Kenya can be expected to be. This would be valuable in judging the extrapolation of costs to other countries (both those included in the study as well as others).We have read this submission.

This is an important study to help strengthen antimicrobial resistance activities worldwide. However, I think prior to publishing this work, a few details could be added and very minor reorganization would benefit the manuscript and make the authors’ statement even stronger.Study design: The authors utilized a combination of article and website review (including the WHO AMR plan) and site visits to three countries to compile data for this manuscript. This seems appropriate given the current state of AMR activity in LMICs.Specific comments:Title: AppropriateAbstract: Reflective of the introduction, methods and results.Introduction: Appropriate to the topic.Methods: Clear and concise. The methods description would not allow for an exact replication of the author’s work, but the nature of the work presented here does not make that a necessary. It would be helpful for the authors to note why they chose the three locations for site visits – to understand the context in which they approached their evaluation. Their costing data for all sites is based on their visit to Kenya’s site, which may not fully represent costs at the other sites.Results: The authors cite evidence that only 2/47 African region countries have national AMR plans in place, and only 7/47 have ICP plans in place. However, I think it is worth acknowledging that many other countries have plans under discussion at the national level, which are anticipated to soon be in place. In addition, it may be worth mentioning that some countries are pursuing surveillance and reporting for AMR on other levels, e.g. as GARP members and through the CDDEP. This may be further reported in Supplementary File 1, but would be worth a brief mention in the main text. The emerging themes in strengthening lab capacity for AMR are discussed. I am surprised that poor staffing levels and lack of necessary equipment did not emerge as themes. In my experience, one of the most common complaints is that 1) there are not enough staff employed to do the work, and 2) the supplies necessary to carry out the work are not there. In the section on country case studies, the target audience for the author’s considerations and recommendations is not clear. Is this meant for the general reader to consider, when making surveillance plans? Is this a message to the governments of each respective country? Researchers? It would be helpful to understand better to whom these recommendations are being made, in order to ensure they reach their target. For the costing results, the first 2 sentences might belong better in the methods. Also, it would help the reader to understand why these assumptions (1 sentinel site per 5 million people, 5 sites per country) were made – is this standard? I think it would also be helpful to present some of the actual projected costs of starting and maintaining AMR surveillance at 1 or more sites based on the costing analysis undertaken. The current discussion is theoretical, but without showing the funds needed to begin/continue AMR surveillance, it is hard to know how much of a burden this might represent for governments or other organizations, and what it would take to get started.Conclusions: The authors highlight themes for success in AMR surveillance and challenges that are common across sites, and also those that differ between sites. Here, they also acknowledge the human resource deficit that has a particularly negative impact on developing laboratory capacity for AMR surveillance, a critically important theme. I would like to see the authors give perspective on what the cost, staffing, and infrastructure thresholds would be in order for countries to adopt an AMR surveillance program. The authors discuss high-level expertise in-country and engagement with ministries of health as important steps, but they don’t discuss the costs or practical trade-offs of what this would look like in any of the countries studied, or others. It would be nice to have a more definitive recommendation or understanding of what is possible in specific places, rather than only a general overview stating the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders.I have read this submission.

It is interesting to read. However certain areas need to be strengthened.
The title is a mouthful. I may not have a better format but a mechanism to remove repeated words like ‘capacity’ may generate a more focused title.One silent feature of the write-up is surveillance in animals and the environment. In this era of sustainable development goals that looks at a more comprehensive perspective of human health and actively interacting and interfacing with the environment, surveillance for antimicrobial resistance would fall short if it does not put into consideration the use of antibiotics in the environment and how these affect resistance in humans. As a scientific article, it may be helpful to refer to sources of antimicrobial resistance outside the human health care system.It is good the authors talk about the relevance of governance and legislation in the conclusion. The legal framework and enforcement are key factors in antibiotic use. Some more details on this in the body would be helpful to the reader.The methods section is not written in sufficient detail for the reader to replicate the study. Suffice it to say that one may need to read the report to get the details but if the manuscript is to stand on its own, more details need to be inserted.The presentation may need some improvement. Tables are given and can be easily understood. However, when reports are referred to, there is no mention of the highlights from the report in the manuscript. The reader has to click onto the links and read the reports before understanding the text. If some highlights on what the reader expects to pick from the reports are put in the text, this could prime the readers to go to these reports for more detailed information.The discussion seems to be merged with the results which is fine. However, an interrogation of the findings vis-à-vis current literature would be helpful. Six of the 14 references are reports. More citations from laboratory surveillance studies would help in strengthening the discussion especially that the scope is low and middle income countries which are many more than the three or four countries where data was collected.This may depend on the house rules but for the reader to go systematically through the writing, one would benefit from the results and discussion being presented with respect to the objectives namely; i) To map and compare existing models for laboratory system strengthening (for AMR surveillance) and ii) To map and compare existing AMR surveillance systems in at least three countries, identifying different approaches for monitoring emergence and spread of resistance in different countries or regional settings. The results are presented according to the data collection methods and a reader would still want to put all the results together synthesize them according to the objectives stated so that they key findings coming out can be discussed with reference to other current literature.The authors present an interesting conceptual framework. The use of this framework in the data collection and results comes out although not in a systematic way. However, this could be due to the way results were presented which is according to data collection methods and not the conceptual framework. If the authors abide by the house rules, that would be fine although presenting results taking into consideration the conceptual framework helps readers to follow the story better.

et al. and the accompanying roadmap offers a comprehensive framework to build a national human health AMR surveillance system. It is clearly presented and is a very helpful guide for the many low and middle income countries that are setting up surveillance systems at present. The Fleming Fund, which sponsored this study, is using the roadmap in discussions for support to countries. There is a need for similar help in other areas of the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in animals and the environment, antimicrobial use, and in linking all these areas together as a one health approach.  The roadmap proposes a sentinel site system at three levels core, extended and advanced. The core level is intended to be the minimum acceptable standard and setting this standard is very helpful. The extended and advanced levels give suggestions for how to improve the quality of the surveillance. As many of these suggestions can be implemented individually the authors should consider representing these as a progression in each area rather than as discrete levels. For example surveillance systems may choose to use software such as WHONET for entry and analysis of antibiotic susceptibility data at even core level facilities.  The choice of blood culture as the starting point for surveillance is understandable due to the seriousness of sepsis. Blood culture is not however the easiest sample type to begin with from both clinical and laboratory perspectives. It is expensive and technically challenging, the rate of positivity is often low. The authors should consider to recommend that countries also start with one or more other sample type at core level. Both urine and stool are easier and cheaper to deal with and have a limited range of reportable species within GLASS. Surveillance of these would produce useful data much faster than blood culture.  The value of linking surveillance with research could be further emphasised. Many countries have proficient research organisations that are eager to be involved and have existing capabilities and equipment (for example next gen sequencers) that can be used to enhance the usefullness of the surveillance data. Some countries will choose to run surveillance at site with existing capacity such as demographic surveillance which are general run by research groups. Linkage with academic institutions will also be useful in encouraging full exploration and use of the data that comes out of the surveillance, an area in which there is little guidance.We have read this submission.

The proposed conceptual frame work for monitoring AMR in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) is comprehensive and detailed. There are however, a few fundamental issues that should be considered to improve the quality of data, host country compliance and benefit, and sustainability of the programme. 
In most LMIC settings, there is unrestricted use and access to a broad range of antibiotics. The unrestricted use is largely driven by the absence of microbiology diagnostic laboratories both at Government and public health facilities. At these locations access cannot be ethically restricted if health care facilities are not equipped with microbiology diagnostic laboratories with trained personnel to provide quality diagnostic services at affordable cost to the general population. Provision of such facilities will effectively guide and restrict antibiotic use and enhance the quality of AMR surveillance data. Thus, the approach to implementing effective surveillance for AMR in LMIC settings need to be 3-pronged: a) Strengthening microbiology diagnostic services at all tiers of both private and Government run health care services b) Use of laboratory data to guide and restrict antibiotic use c)Creating effective and sustainable AMR surveillance.Since ultimately the goal of setting up AMR surveillance includes monitoring the economic impact, it is important to actively incorporate plans for monitoring clinical outcomes in any framework for LMIC settings. At most locations, it is not customary to return to a health care facility after an acute illness, and record keeping is often less than optimal, thus acquisition of clinical outcome data may warrant a proactive plan with home visits or an outreach team that is based in the community for early, intermediate or late outcomes. A key component of AMR surveillance is timely dissemination of surveillance data to relevant stakeholders. The programme should include plans to extend timely dissemination of surveillance data beyond scientific and medical community to include the general public, policy-makers and governments. This will be crucial to raising the levels of awareness of AMR and local ownership in order to ensure sustainability of the programme in LMICs.

The strong case for the research advantages of linking electronic health records is made very clearly and interesting examples selected to illustrate the arguments. The paper also addresses important areas that are potential concerns or limitations; for example evidence for the quality of the NHS data and approaches to making data that has been collected in different locations and time-periods comparable are well-described. As well as referring to earlier papers, much of the supporting information on the participant cohort or needed to assess the procedures used and organisation and labelling of the datafiles are briefly referred to in the paper with the detail necessary available via links to other websites.

Data security measures are also described on the Safe Haven websites.

This is a volunteer cohort of adults with extensive research data including imaging, genomic, -omic and other phenotyping for whom consent was asked for linkage to different types of data available from other sources, most particularly health service records. This builds on the outstanding opportunities that exist in Scotland which has suffered less from fragmentation and barriers to access to appropriate routine data than particularly England. Most provided consent so that there is a rich set of data, being continuously updated but which researchers can seek approval to access at any one time for approved research. The paper describes the data linkage itself in detail, outlining the nature of the datasets and the processes. This is, in of itself, valuable for cohorts elsewhere as these are areas that have been extremely challenging to pursue, even when consent from individuals is present. Data are available for a decade on these individuals.  Much of the data to fully understand the cohort is available in other publications, most notably the International Journal of Epidemiology cohort series. The reader cannot establish from this paper what the provenance of the cohort is in terms of its relationship to the source Scottish population (response rate, known response biases etc) but this is not the purpose of the paper. Perhaps it should not be called a Family Health Study given its likely response biases and the fact it is very unlikely to be fully representative of Scotlands families, but this is more important for the detail of what kind of research these rich data lend themselves to and what they would not be so well suited to.  The description of how to access looks very good, but it is in the doing that people find out what it’s really like.

Our response to each of the comments is given in italics below:This is a well-written paper on a neglected health problem in Kenya. Two recent studies have contributed anecdotal data that suggest a significant burden of disease in urban areas, and have identified vitamin D deficiency as the likely cause of rickets in many cases (note that this is different to most other settings in Africa). The current study provides the first proper epidemiologic data from Kenya, and there are some remarkable findings. That 6% of paediatric inpatients in a hospital in a region with abundant sunlight have rickets is quite extraordinary; could the authors put this into context - has similar prevalence been recorded elsewhere?  Review articles by Prentice
1 and more recently by Creo et al
2 cite studies in areas with abundant sunshine in Asia and Africa where prevalence of nutritional rickets was estimated to be higher than 6%. For example, a nationwide survey estimated a prevalence of 8% in children under 10 years of age
3 and a survey study in Northern Nigeria estimated a prevalence of 9% in children under 3 years of age
4. In general the approaches and analyses are sound. There is a lot of emphasis on length of stay, I presume as a proxy for severity/complexity, though it is a difficult parameter to interpret (certainly in low-resource settings in Kenya, where length of stay can be artificially inflated by delays in payment, for example). I don’t feel that figures 2 or 3 add a great deal to the argument and I would be minded put them into a supplementary file.We understand the reviewer’s point of view, however we believe that the length-of-stay (LOS) metric suggest a cost aspect to a rickets diagnosis. It is rare for patients to be detained for non-payment of hospital fees in the sites in the study. Furthermore the discharge dates used in computing LOS were the medical discharge date and not the administrative discharge date. There is also a potential, at least for pneumonia, that clinical signs such as lower chest wall indrawing take longer to resolve in children with Rickets resulting in longer stays.Two frequently reported associations of vitamin D deficiency are developmental delay and TB. Can the authors look for any association with these conditions? I expect that developmental delay is probably not well coded in your data so it may not be possible, but I bet that TB is coded much better. I think this would really add value to the paper. (A section will need to be added to the discussion about the difficulty in robustly diagnosing TB in Kenya and similar settings.)We did explore the relationship between TB and rickets however the admission and discharge data in our network was not rich enough for robust inference, we had less than 1% of admissions with a TB diagnosis which were mostly clinical diagnoses. This rate is likely un under-diagnosis of TB, diagnosing TB in young children is difficult. Advanced TB diagnostics tools such as GeneXpert have not yet entered common use in the sites in our study.  It is widely felt that there is under-diagnosis of TB in younger children and specific work is being undertaken to make better diagnostic tools available with a view to exploring the links of TB with Vitamin D deficiency.The discussion section is sound, but would do well to highlight even further the difficulty in diagnosing rickets in Kenya and similar settings, which makes studying it so difficult. Rickets is best diagnosed by a combination of clinical, radiographical and biochemical features, but I expect that most children in this study were diagnosed clinically alone.

Please see the updated version of the article. We are also grateful to the reviewer for bringing to our attention these new studies of rickets and have cited them in the new version.References

Utilizing hospital admission and discharge data on over 20,000 admissions routinely collected through the Clinical Information Network they were able to identify children under 5 years where ""rickets"" was recorded in the discharge diagnosis. Significant differences were noted across the three regions with only one case identified in the Western region with the highest prevalence reported from one hospital in Nairobi. The majority of cases as would be anticipated were under the age of 2 years with a significant association with malnutrition defined as a weight for age Z-score (<-2.0). Previous work has suggested an association between rickets and/or vitamin D deficiency with pneumonia. However despite a high prevalence of admissions with pneumonia such an association was only seen in the Western region. It is also of interest that no increased risk of mortality was seen in children with rickets given the potential association between vitamin D deficiency and innate immunity. The authors discuss potential explanations for the variation in prevalence seen across the three regions such as rates of poverty particularly in Nairobi. They have highlighted the potential relevance of differences in dietary practices in particular the lack of dietary calcium intake of the cereal based diet in Central Kenya. It is now well recognized that dietary calcium intake has an important role in addition to vitamin D deficiency in the aetiology of nutritional rickets. The authors have highlighted the potential limitations of their work particularly the fact that many children with rickets are managed as outpatients and therefore will not be identified in hospital discharge data. Another important factor is the dependence on clinical signs such as lower limb deformities for the diagnosis of rickets. The recent Global Consensus guidelines on Nutritional Rickets
1 recommended that the diagnosis is made on the basis of history,physical examination and biochemical results and is confirmed by radiographs. It is recognized that access to such investigations may be difficult in countries such as Kenya but it would have been useful if radiographs were available in a subset of the sample to see what proportion of cases of rickets were confirmed on X-ray. In a similar setting in the Gambia where bone deformity was used as a diagnostic marker for rickets only in 9% of cases was this confirmed by X-ray
2. Two additional comments I would make are: 1) Considering the survey was conducted over 1 year it would be useful if the authors were able to calculate the incidence of nutritional rickets assuming they have information on the population of children less than 5 years in the regions surveyed. Incidence data for this condition is quite limited worldwide. 2) It is not clear to this reviewer what is represented on the Y-axis of Figure 2.I have read this submission.

The problem with studying swarming behavior (as opposed to mating behavior) is the difficulty of having sensible questions to ask.  I have watched and filmed swarms of anophelines for many hours (mainly in Mozambique) and still am not sure what the most relevant ones, at least without sophisticated equipment, might be. There is always more perspiration than inspiration. This paper describes the basics of swarms of
Anopheles arabiensis but I have a number of questions regarding some of the information in the paper. For example, having recently observed swarms of
An. arabiensis in Eritrea (but only over a period of two weeks and in a single village) I remain at a loss regarding definitions of swarm markers for this species. The swarms I observed occurred over a very slightly darker area of sand in a dry riverbed but the mosquitoes did not alter their behavior when either a light cloth or dark T-shirt was placed under the swarming mosquitoes.  I am therefore of the opinion that I have no real clue what the insects were using to maintain station. (This is unlike the situation with
An. coluzzii, which will follow a dark cloth or
An. pharoensis which follow light ones). I am, therefore, not convinced that the so-called markers described in the present study were actually being used by the
An. arabiensis. Their wide variety indicates that they were just in the area and that something else was the actual ‘marker’.  Only by manipulating apparent markers and seeing their effect on the swarms can we be sure that they are for real. In Eritrea males left their diurnal resting sites once light levels had fallen to around 520 Lux (which occurred at different times according to whether it was cloudy or not) and immediately started swarming. There was no delay.  As the authors indicate swarming did not last long but at the same time, as they also point out, the cessation of swarming was coincident with difficulty of actually observing the insects so it is difficult to be sure that activity had ceased. Swarms of
An. funestus, monitored with a video camera with infra-red capabilities in Mozambique, continued beyond the time that they could be seen with the naked eye. So a caveat regarding ending time should be included. The change in start times according to sunset times was also recorded in
An. coluzzii from São Tomé and should perhaps be referenced. Sweep netting, of course, does not remove all of the insects from a swarm. A better alternative is to take a flash photograph and then use a program like imageJ to count objects of different sizes in the image (which can be compared to counts done by hand). Since most pictures are taken from below the swarm the only objects in such pictures are the mosquitoes. Should two insects overlap then their combined size is larger than individual insects and so they are considered by the program to be a separate category. It may even be possible to use the camera on a smartphone, now widely available, to take such pictures. Similarly I saw (perhaps) just a single pair in copula in Eritrea. These are normally very easy to see since the pair is larger and flies more slowly than individual insects (the male and female flying in different directions). They almost invariably leave the swarm (the female dragging the male behind her. It is only perhaps when a small female mates with a larger male that they continue in the swarm, the male in this case pulling the female behind him). In all their observations the authors report ‘observing and collecting 22 copulation events’. (Difficult to know how you collect an event). I think that this begs the question as to whether, like ‘love and marriage’ these phenomena really go together (and the ones in Eritrea) really were ‘mating swarms’.  In São Tomé pairs dropped out of the swarms ‘like flies’ (if you’ll excuse the pun).  Something more is going on – but we don’t know what it is. I think it is a misnomer to call them mating swarms. Indeed it is worth discussing the fact that so few mating pairs were seen. It is possible that mating was largely taking place in swarms elsewhere. To watch swarms and note their behavior does indeed not require that much professional input. In São Tomé the swarm with mating was discovered by a two-year-old child who had to really persist to get the ‘professionals’ attention! The authors also found that 12 of 28 females collected from swarms had been inseminated. Like one of the other reviewers I also find this very strange. Did these insects have mating plugs? What were they doing there?  Elsewhere, as mentioned above, pairs in copula leave the swarm before the male ejaculates. The females do not return (as shown by the absence of multiple mating plugs in the many hundreds of females that have been examined).  My own suspicion would be that the volunteers were being bitten and included these females in the sample. It is also interesting that males with un-rotated terminalia were collected. Since these males would probably have ecloded the previous evening they would have been almost 24hrs old at the time of the swarm it implies that rotation takes longer than a day. But I was of the impression that that was all the time that was needed. Some comment on this might also be informative. Mosquitoes swarm close to where they rest. Rather than attempting to target swarms per se a better and more sustainable method of control would be to find the resting site (and here the swarming site could be used as an indicator of nearby resting sites) and intervene there. If, as is likely, there are common characteristics between resting sites (a dark background perhaps) then it might also be possible to develop and deploy artificial resting sites that might be treated with a non-repellent insecticide or a factor that the males might transfer to the females that they mate with to affect them. Since newly emerged females also often share the same resting site as the males such an intervention would work against them too. I agree with the comments of the other referees in that the article could be a lot shorter, that the figures could be improved and the text be made more concise.I have read this submission.

The motivation of the study, as stated by the authors is that after the pioneering work of Marchand and later of Charlwood in East Africa, there have been no studies of swarming behavior of African anophelines in that region. The absence of observations on swarms of A. gambiae s.l., despite some efforts, led some to doubt the relevance of swarms to mating in these species, especially in that region. By replicating older results, the authors confirmed the role of swarming behavior to mating across Africa. Thus, the results, mostly replicate previous studies including: swarm formation time after sunset, swarm size range, and association with ground markers. The study relied on trained local village observers/collectors following earlier studies in Mali and Burkina Faso (cited). The paper reads easily (and pleasantly) but it could be improved by a substantial reduction in length, adhering to concise and more precise scientific writing, and possibly addressing specific questions/hypotheses, as suggested below. Major comments:
Because this study is a descriptive survey of swarms that mostly replicate previous studies (it could cite other studies for details on the Methods), it would better fit a “Research Note” or a much shorter article. Suggestions to accomplish that include replacing Fig. 1 with a brief text and removal of Fig. 2, which is not informative. The Methods section could be reduced to 1/4 of its current length. The detailed description of the training for swarm spotters/collectors, should be summarized in 3 sentences including the description of training in standard entomological and field ecology methods, which would better rely on citations. The first section of the Results “Results of exploratory surveys: initial evidence of Anopheles swarms,” (which repeats information given in the Methods) could be removed (also from the Methods section) or replaced by a single sentence such as: “The initial exploration, confirmed that Anopheles swarms do occur in the study area.” Additionally, there are repetitions and unnecessary details that dilute the main message. Certain terms must be defined accurately. For example a “swarm” may represent a single observation of males flying stationary above a marker in a single evening or to the site, where such aggregations were observed on multiple evenings. When stated that 216 swarms were observed, it is not clear which definition was used. Likewise, the term “sub-village” is vague. Please define its area. Despite the long Method section, I could not find a summary of the sampling effort i.e. the number of swarm collectors operating throughout the year in every village, which is essential. Did the same team passed between villages in different times or they were divided between the villages? How were the swarm spotter/collectors been evaluated in terms of quality and efficiency of work?Interestingly, large differences were found among villages in the number of swarms and their sizes. Could these differences reflect different density of A. arabiensis overall in these villages (it would be helpful to include average indoor density if such data exist)? Were the sampling effort the same between villages in terms of the number of collectors/observers, duration of activity, and their work-quality, or hospitality of local residents? Were the sampling conducted at the same time across all villages? For example, if the survey in one village occurred in a dryer period, it might account for the lower number and sizes of the swarms. What other factors might explain that variation (e.g., availability of suitable markers)?
 Minor/Specific points: Background
“Most insects mate in swarms, whereby dispersed populations aggregate at specific times...” – this statement might meant to refer to diptera or to culicids. I doubt it holds for all insects. The references given focused on dipterans. Please check and confirm.“Targeting swarms to deplete mosquito densities indeed offer unrivalled opportunities to drastically reduce mosquito-borne pathogen transmission” – in what way it is unrivalled?“Such an approach has proven effective against some Anopheles mosquitoes on a limited scale in Burkina Faso14, but needs to be validated for other vector species in other areas. ..thus targeting them could be easily achieved by trained community volunteers. … easy control target.” I afraid the scalability of this approach for regional, country and continental control is a heavy challenge that cannot be described as “easy”. There are other control strategies that can be effective in a single village or few villages, but can’t be effectively scaled up. For example draining or insecticide-treating all larval sites in certain villages to drastically reduce transmission, but unless the scalability issue has been addressed, the promise if this strategy is doubtful. Therefore the promise of the proposed new approach should be considered seriously with its limitations.“ ..a combination of crowd-sourced community knowledge22, intensive field surveys and expert advice” –  specifically what “crowd sourced community knowledge” was obtained.
 Results:
Figure 3 – the legend is very small and nearly impossible to read. It would help to have on large-font and uniform legend for all 3 villages. Please clarify if (i) all houses in the area depicted are shown, ie., there are no other houses (not shown) regardless if they “officially belong” to the village, gpsed etc.. Also, what is the reason that the background to C is different? The landscape around the villages may be better conveyed using Google Earth (than a green color). Figure 3 summarizes large body of spatial information. It might be interesting to extract measures of inter-swarm distances, its seasonal variation, and effect of swarm size, as well as the variation between villages.Figure 4. The authors explain the variation in the swarming time by the change in sunset time. Thus, please add the corresponding line (curve) showing the sunset time and include the correlation between these variables in the Figure.Figure 5. Unless many observations are on top each other, the number of swarms observed appear to be 4-6/month, which amount to mere ~60 observations total rather than 216 as understood from the top of the results. If there are on top of each other, the author can consider jittering observations and changing their symbol to better appreciate the weight of each value. Please clarify.Table 2 shows variation in swarm occurrence on different markers. I suggest that authors reshape the table by listing all the swarm markers along the rows (in groups based on their classification) and have the columns show the percent (and total number) of swarms above each marker across villages. This will allow the reader to compare the ranking of the markers. Moreover, it might be helpful to know how many such markers exist in the surveyed area. For example if there are no rice fields or banana trees in one village and many in another, it will be difficult for the mosquitoes to express their preference for banana tees, etc.  The interpretation of this table can be expanded in the discussion.The authors may want to comment on whether the collection of a proportion of inseminated females in swarms as well as some funestus specimens might reflect collection of mosquitoes that are not related to the swarming activity.

Conclusions from data are again based on observational inferences but this kind of study is useful precisely for that reason. Certain matters remain unclear and these have to do in particular with the location of swarms and what is meant by swarm markers.  For example, a category of swarm marker is rice field and another is banana tree and another is toilet by which we must mean latrine shed.  These are all entirely different environmental features with very different shapes, sizes, compositions, origins, and so on.  From the observations one cannot make a strong conclusion about the particular configuration of what is meant by ""swarm maker"" typologically.  That is, are swarm markers typically of a certain configuration or do swarms form just about anywhere the initial males starting them begin to fly at a particular spot?  The authors should clarify this issue as a point of discussion.  Secondly is the problem of what is meant by contrast or no contrast swarm markers.  I do not know what this means.  Do they mean contrast with a horizon, contrast between two hues or shades, ... ?  As a a means of providing a particular attribute of a typical swarm marker, the use of this descriptor of contrast is vague. The writing style is generally quite good and the manuscript needs little adjustment for editing.  The caption legends for Figure 5 are awkward.  The X axis could simply read Visual Estimate and the Y axis could read Sweep Net Estimate.  I see no reason to include a polynomial fit to the data on this figure because the relationship looks plainly linear.  There seem to be two data points tucked up high in the upper right corner but they are obscured by the regression information. In the last paragraph of the Results section, the following sentence should be revised: ""Of the 28 female anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes dissected, 54% (N=15) were determined as nulliparous. The remaining 46% (N=13) were not examinable since the specimen had dried up.""  It should read as follows: ""of the 28 female An. arabiensis dissected, fifteen were nulliparous and the remainder were too dry to determine parity status."" In Table 2, the structure of the table needs some changes reflecting the clarification of the contrast and no contrast comment above.  By cowshed must be meant the area of land where cows are stanchioned at night.  This is not a 'cowshed' in the usual sense but rather a flat piece of ground where the animals are kept at night.  If it is a kraal type of situation, there may be some living or nonliving fence in place in which case it cannot be flat.  Otherwise, explain how a cowshed is flat.  Under elevated contrast markers, I would like to know if by ant hills is meant termite mounds.  Please clarify.  My experience is east Africa is that ant hills are quite low to the ground and indiscernible whereas termite mounds are of course tower like structures and clearly elevated. Some banana trees are quite tall.  How did the citizens with the sweep nets manage to sample over them? It is interesting that Figure 3 shows that in some locations the swarms form independently or distance from houses whereas in other locations the swarms form mostly amongst dense clusters of houses.  Compare panel 1 and panel 2, for example.  Why is this?

The abstract discussion is written in terms of a project that has illustrated an outcome and that relied on strong rapport.  The results or evaluation of the project aren’t presented here, so perhaps this should be rephrased in terms of intention to demonstrate or likely outcomes in future tense rather than past tense. The introduction could provide useful additional context if it mentioned what is being done on the Thai/Cambodia border, and also the recent findings of spread of resistant parasite clones in Vietnam. The methods mention GPS and GLONASS.  Why were both used?  And what was done when there were discrepant readings? Under Community Engagement “MPs” is first used without spelling out (defined next paragraph as Malaria Posts). What was done when the initial CE team contact suggested concerns or frank resistance?  Were there pre-prepared FAQ sheets and other sensitization materials ready?  Were any materials translated/backtranslated? Were there processes established for monitoring completeness of data collection in real time and sending queries for out-of-range values? Malaria Prevalence Surveys: What was the software and algorithm used for the randomization process? How was randomization applied to villagers?  Were they all enumerated first and then randomly selected to receive a return visit or was the process more “on the ground”.  Were whole households sampled (convenient) or were villagers sampled across households? For the PCR how were the standards produced and quality controlled?  (Presumably from known high parasitaemia cultures diluted through uninfected blood, but this isn't stated). Antimalarial resistance monitoring was done at MPs but not in community surveys.  Is it possible a reservoir of resistance among low density parasitaemias in the community would be missed like this? Under statistical analysis could consider using SATScan, and perhaps looking at prevalence of resistance for spatial clustering as well as prevalence of infection?  For positive vs negative results it may be appropriate to look at Ripley’s K function for cases/controls rather than Moran’s I which is for continuous data, since the binned prevalences won’t consider sample size in each location, and the prevalences are unlikely to be normally distributed. Data: The shape files and locations of villages could be considered study data, and would be useful to those who subsequently work in the field.  However the data may well be too sensitive to post open access, in which case a note should be made regarding a data governance system via which applications for data can be made. Discussion: The second paragraph limitations would be readily addressed by using SATScan, which would take the arbitrary definition away from the protocol and address neighbouring villages for hotspots. The evaluation of effectiveness of this protocol when put into practice on the ground, and the epidemiological data generated will be very interesting and important.  This is a really major and very important undertaking.I have read this submission.

et al. report here a detailed analysis of plus-strand (+strand) ""
tax"" and anti-sense (
hbz) RNA transcripts in HTLV-1 T cell clones that have been cultured
ex vivo from CD4+CD25+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of 4 different patients. Each clone, harboring a single entire copy of the HTLV-1 genome, was cultured under periodic activation with IL-2, and anti CD2, CD3 and CD28 mAbs. All analyses were performed at day 8 of the 14 day activation cycle, when most cells are returning to a resting state. Single cell analyses of HTLV-1 RNA expression were based on integration of single molecule RNA-FISH and DAPI nuclear staining with occasional actinomycin D treatment. Under these conditions, the authors observed that the vast majority of cells harbored detectable levels of
hbz transcripts, while accumulation of +strand transcripts (which they refer to as ""
tax"", see below) was more heterogeneous, varying from <10% in cells from 2 of the clones, to 50-60% of cells from the other 2 clones. An additional clone that harbored a deleted provirus, and thereby did not produce +strand transcripts, served as control. The authors further showed that both sense and anti-sense transcripts could be detected within larger nuclear spots in 4 to 7% of the cells analyzed, which the authors interpreted as transcriptional bursts; this interpretation was confirmed by the significant drop of bursts observed after treatment with actinomycin D. Act D further allowed the authors to show that +strand ""
tax"" transcripts were rapidly accumulating to the cytoplasm while
hbz transcripts remained in the nucleus. According to the authors, and in agreement with former observations by several teams,
hbz and
tax transcripts were in general inversely related. Also, the authors report that both types of transcripts tended to accumulate in cells in G2/M as compared to G0/G1 (monitored as a function of DAPI signal). Elucidation of the
in vivo dynamics of Hbz versus Tax production at the single cell level should indeed help elucidate the
in vivo regulation of latent versus productive HTLV-1 infection, and provide precious clues on the pathogenic outcomes following infection. Despite an impressive amount of data cross-analyses based on +strand and anti-sense transcription of T cell clones derived from patients' PBMCs, the actual relevance of the model for
in vivo situations is questionable. Thus, all analyses were performed on 4 clones isolated from a subpopulation of CD4+CD25+ T cells (as described in a reference and not mentioned here), which after being isolated from patients PBMCs, were cultured for a long period of time in conditions that do not reproduce
in vivo conditions (hyperoxia, hyperglycemia, strong recurrent activations and absence of immune pressure). As such, several of the authors' conclusions (in the title, abstract and discussion) are not warranted (see below). As presented, the study brings up other several additional points:
The authors state that all HTLV-1 +strand transcripts are detected with the so-called ""
tax"" probe. Nevertheless, the constant designation of the transcripts as ""tax"" throughout the article can be very misleading. It would be more accurate to refer to the results obtained with this probe in the text and figures as ""+strand"", or another more inclusive designation, rather than ""
tax"" solely.Nearly 60 to 90% of cells in all 5 clones express
hbz antisense transcripts, but depending on the clone studied, the presence of +strand transcripts, as detected with the ""
tax"" probe, are much more heterogeneous (<10% in clones A and D, and 50-60% in clones B & C). Given this overwhelming heterogeneity, how can the authors exclude that it is not due to variation in Tax-encoding transcripts, but solely to other viral +strand transcripts. In other words, the authors cannot exclude that levels of Tax-encoding transcripts were homogeneously low in all clones.Although the authors insist on the pitfalls of qPCR to analyze single cell transcription, there have been several reports on microfluidics technology being successfully used to monitor single cell RNA expression (i.e. Moussy
et al. 2017. PLoS  Biol 15(7):e2001867). The application of microfluidics on PBMCs directly isolated from patients would likely allow a more accurate assessment of the
in vivo status of RNA transcripts.As mentioned above, given the experimental model of subcloning and culture (at the non-physiological 20% oxygen tension, which artificially modulates HTLV-1 activation, as previously published by the authors), and in the absence of immune pressure, the claim that the results presented here are relevant for
in vivo situations and ""
offer an explanation for the paradoxical correlations observed between the host immune response and HTLV-1 transcription"" is not warranted.Since the correlation between ""transcription bursts"" and the G2/M cell cycle stage is not established for +strand ""tax"" transcripts, and pertains to <7% of cells in which
hbz is detected, the claim of a relationship between viral gene bursts and cell cycle (as stated in the general conclusion and the title) does not appear justified. Therefore, the intricate array of cross analyses and statistical evaluation performed here and addressed lengthily in the discussion is not likely to reflect
in vivo situations.Statistical significance of the correlation between high
hbz expression,
hbz bursts and the G2/M stages should be directly mentioned in Fig. 5 and the corresponding text. The clones used to obtain the data provided in panel 5b are not indicated (it appears that clones A and B were used here, whereas data in 5c are mentioned in the figure legend to result from the average of clones A, B, C and D).Given the reservations mentioned above (an
 in vitro system that does not recapitulate
in vivo conditions, the lack of distinction between
tax versus +strand transcripts, and the lack of data on Tat and HBZ proteins), the discussion remains too speculative.In this study, there is no assessment of the relationship between transcript and protein levels; moreover, since the half-lives of Tax and Hbz proteins in this model are not established, it is not possible to evaluate the actual timing of a potential cross-regulation between the 2 proteins. In this regard, the authors should discuss a recent paper by Baratella
et al. (PLos Negl Trop Dis Jan 2017) that describes the specific accumulation of the HBZ protein in the cytoplasm of PBMCs directly isolated from TSP/HAM patients.In suppl. fig 7 - there is an SEM indicated in the histogram of clone C while there was only 2 replicates, according to the figure legend. Also, in suppl. Figs 8 and 9 there appears to be a color and legend inversion for clones B, C, and D, and clone A does not seem to fit the G2/M correlation with high levels of +strand ""tax"" transcripts.

In this study, the authors screened more than 19 000 cells derived from five naturally infected T cell clones isolated from PBMCs of HTLV-1 healthy donors. They used single-molecule RNA FISH to quantify, at the single cell level, the transcripts of two main products of the HTLV-I pX region, Tax encoded by the plus-strand of the provirus and HBZ encoded by its minus-strand. They observed a strong intra- and inter-clonal heterogeneity in the expression of
tax and
 hbz genes with Tax being expressed at high levels in few cells whereas
hbz is expressed at lower levels in most cells. They also report that both genes are transcribed in intermittent bursts and that tax expression is enhanced in the absence of HBZ but that
hbz expression is enhanced by Tax. Finally, they show that HBZ expression is mostly associated with G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and that its abundance correlates with the nuclear volume. They conclude that the main function of this frequent low level of
hbz transcript and protein is to maintain clonal persistence and that conversely, intense transient intermittent bursts of
tax drive viral replication and clonal proliferation while escaping the robust anti Tax CTL response. These results strongly suggest that the plus strand of HTLV-I is expressed in bursts
in vivo explaining the hitherto unexplained paradoxical observations of a strong anti-Tax immune response in all immuno-competent HTLV-I infected individuals while Tax is undetectable in their freshly isolated PBMCs. This is an important study in the field that defeats multiple previous paradigms. The following experiments should strengthen the manuscript:  
Authors used short-term cultures of activated cells in order to isolate individual cells. However, they need to show
 tax and
 hbz expression at the single cell level in freshly isolated PBMCs since cell culture and activation are likely to affect
 tax and
hbz expression.Figure 1: It is surprising that 1% of uninfected clones (negative control) express 50
tax transcripts and only 1
hbz transcript. More uninfected clones should be tested. Furthermore, in order to validate
tax and
hbz probes, they show the specificity/sensitivity of smFISH on one clone generated from HTLV-I infected cell lines like having different expression levels of Tax and HBZ.It is important to show the viral load and the status of expression of Tax and HBZ in total PBMCs of the 5 HTLV-I positive donors, and compare it with that of the 5 T cell clones that were selected. How can the authors be sure that the selected clone from each donor is a representative one of all the HTLV-1 infected cells in that individual? Did they screen other clones from each of the five donors?Figure 2: Images of
tax bursts are more convincing that those of
hbz. Figure 2D shows that the estimated number of
hbz RNA per burst is around 3 to 4 with little intercellular variation, which is not classical for bursts. How can the authors rule out the possibility that these represent superposition of multiple transcripts. In 2C, they show a three-fold reduction in the frequency of
hbz bursts in the presence of actinomycine D compared to a total disappearance of
tax bursts. What is the percentage reduction of
hbz bursts relative to the reduction of total
hbz transcripts?Figure 3: Estimation of intranuclear mRNA should be done in zStacks to rule out counting transcripts above and below the nucleus.Figure 4: Authors show increased frequency of
hbz bursts in high tax positive cells. Again, what about the total amount of
hbz transcripts in these cells?Elevated
tax and
hbz expression in S and G2/M phase of the cell cycle is solely based on the integrated intensity of the DAPI stained nucleus (2n versus 4n). It would be nice to perform synchronization of cells to confirm these findings.Supplementary Figure 9: The negative control (uninfected cells) and clone E should be shown.Supplementary Figure 10: The odds ratio for G2/M phase is much higher for cells with >4
hbz compared to cells with >99 tax whereas that for S phase is quite similar. Does this indicate that
hbz expression results in G2/M arrest? Is there any correlation between G2/M phase and nuclear size in these cells?

The following experiments should strengthen the manuscript:1.   Authors used short-term cultures of activated cells in order to isolate individual cells. However, they need to show tax and hbz expression at the single cell level in freshly isolated PBMCs since cell culture and activation are likely to affect tax and hbz expression.We agree that it is of great importance and interest to quantify HTLV-1 expression in freshly isolated PBMCs.  To do this, we are indeed now applying the smFISH technique described here to fresh PBMCs.2.   Figure 1: It is surprising that 1% of uninfected clones (negative control) express 50 tax transcripts and only 1 hbz transcript. More uninfected clones should be tested. Furthermore, in order to validate tax and hbz probes, they show the specificity/sensitivity of smFISH on one clone generated from HTLV-I infected cell lines like having different expression levels of Tax and HBZ.We apologize for the confusion. In fact, the frequency of cells with > 1 candidate spot in the negative control cells was ~0.6%. The legend to Figure 5 has now been modified to clarify this point.3.    It is important to show the viral load and the status of expression of Tax and HBZ in total PBMCs of the 5 HTLV-I positive donors, and compare it with that of the 5 T cell clones that were selected. How can the authors be sure that the selected clone from each donor is a representative one of all the HTLV-1 infected cells in that individual? Did they screen other clones from each of the five donors?We have previously shown that a typical HTLV-1-infected host carries > 10
5 infected T-cell clones, it is therefore not practical to study a representative sample of individual clones.  Rather, the present study was designed to establish points of principle. We aim to tackle the question of representativeness by quantifying mRNA expression in fresh polyclonal PBMCs isolated from infected individuals: this work is now in progress.4.   Figure 2: Images of tax bursts are more convincing that those of hbz. Figure 2D shows that the estimated number of hbz RNA per burst is around 3 to 4 with little intercellular variation, which is not classical for bursts. How can the authors rule out the possibility that these represent superposition of multiple transcripts. In 2C, they show a three-fold reduction in the frequency of hbz bursts in the presence of actinomycine D compared to a total disappearance of tax bursts. What is the percentage reduction of hbz bursts relative to the reduction of total hbz transcripts?Since the abundance of hbz mRNA is so low under all circumstances, there is indeed no strong distinction in the majority of cells between continuous hbz transcription and hbz bursts. The approach we have taken is described in detail in the Materials and Methods section.5.   Figure 3: Estimation of intranuclear mRNA should be done in zStacks to rule out counting transcripts above and below the nucleus.In developing the current protocol, we did indeed quantify the transcripts in z-stacks lying above or below the nucleus in individual cells. It was not practicable to inspect individual z-stacks on the large total number of cells studied (N > 19,000). However, the small error introduced by quantifying the distribution in 2D would not alter the major conclusions reached here on the distinction between the distribution of plus-strand transcripts and
hbz transcripts.6.    Figure 4: Authors show increased frequency of hbz bursts in high tax positive cells. Again, what about the total amount of hbz transcripts in these cells?The total
hbz spot count is indeed raised in the cells with a high plus-strand spot count.  However, the logistic regression analysis (see Supplementary Figure 10), showed that the
hbz spot count was correlated with the occurrence of
hbz bursts, so it may not be meaningful to separate the two parameters here.7.    Elevated tax and hbz expression in S and G2/M phase of the cell cycle is solely based on the integrated intensity of the DAPI stained nucleus (2n versus 4n). It would be nice to perform synchronization of cells to confirm these findings.This is a good suggestion, and in fact these experiments are already underway.8.    Supplementary Figure 9: The negative control (uninfected cells) and clone E should be shown.Since the frequency of cells in the negative (uninfected) control (see point 2 above) and the tax-negative Clone E was <1%, the cell-cycle analysis of the frequency distribution of smFISH spots was not carried out with these clones.9.    Supplementary Figure 10: The odds ratio for G2/M phase is much higher for cells with >4 hbz compared to cells with >99 tax whereas that for S phase is quite similar. Does this indicate that hbz expression results in G2/M arrest? Is there any correlation between G2/M phase and nuclear size in these cells?It has previously been shown that hbz promotes progression through the cell cycle (Satou et al 2006; Mitobe et al 2015: refs. 39 and 40 in the paper). We therefore infer that this is the cause of the high odds ratio referred to, although our results do not exclude the possibility that a proportion of these cells are in G2/M arrest.Reviewer 3 (Sitbon) 
Billman et al. report here a detailed analysis of plus-strand (+strand) ""tax"" and anti-sense (hbz) RNA transcripts in HTLV-1 T cell clones that have been cultured ex vivo from CD4+CD25+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of 4 different patients. Each clone, harboring a single entire copy of the HTLV-1 genome, was cultured under periodic activation with IL-2, and anti CD2, CD3 and CD28 mAbs. All analyses were performed at day 8 of the 14 day activation cycle, when most cells are returning to a resting state. Single cell analyses of HTLV-1 RNA expression were based on integration of single molecule RNA-FISH and DAPI nuclear staining with occasional actinomycin D treatment.
Under these conditions, the authors observed that the vast majority of cells harbored detectable levels of hbz transcripts, while accumulation of +strand transcripts (which they refer to as ""tax"", see below) was more heterogeneous, varying from <10% in cells from 2 of the clones, to 50-60% of cells from the other 2 clones. An additional clone that harbored a deleted provirus, and thereby did not produce +strand transcripts, served as control. The authors further showed that both sense and anti-sense transcripts could be detected within larger nuclear spots in 4 to 7% of the cells analyzed, which the authors interpreted as transcriptional bursts; this interpretation was confirmed by the significant drop of bursts observed after treatment with actinomycin D. Act D further allowed the authors to show that +strand ""tax"" transcripts were rapidly accumulating to the cytoplasm while hbz transcripts remained in the nucleus. According to the authors, and in agreement with former observations by several teams, hbz and tax transcripts were in general inversely related. Also, the authors report that both types of transcripts tended to accumulate in cells in G2/M as compared to G0/G1 (monitored as a function of DAPI signal).Elucidation of the in vivo dynamics of Hbz versus Tax production at the single cell level should indeed help elucidate the in vivo regulation of latent versus productive HTLV-1 infection, and provide precious clues on the pathogenic outcomes following infection. Despite an impressive amount of data cross-analyses based on +strand and anti-sense transcription of T cell clones derived from patients' PBMCs, the actual relevance of the model for in vivo situations is questionable. Thus, all analyses were performed on 4 clones isolated from a subpopulation of CD4+CD25+ T cells (as described in a reference and not mentioned here), which after being isolated from patients PBMCs, were cultured for a long period of time in conditions that do not reproduce in vivo conditions (hyperoxia, hyperglycemia, strong recurrent activations and absence of immune pressure). As such, several of the authors' conclusions (in the title, abstract and discussion) are not warranted (see below). We agree that it remains to be proved how well the pattern of HTLV-1 transcription we report in these clones in vitro reflects the behaviour of the virus in vivo.  In the paper we do not of course claim to have provided this proof: rather, we state ‘If this pattern of HTLV-1 gene expression accurately represents the pattern of expression in vivo, the paradoxes [three identified] can be explained as follows:’;   and elsewhere ‘The results reported here offer an explanation for each of these paradoxes’ and that our results ‘strongly suggest[s] that the HTLV-1 plus-strand is expressed in bursts in vivo.’  That is, we believe these results offer, but do not prove, a simple and logical explanation of the observations in vivo.  In the revised manuscript we have modified the conclusion section of the Abstract, and added a section to the Discussion (see point 7 below), to further clarify this important point: As presented, the study brings up other several additional points:1.   The authors state that all HTLV-1 +strand transcripts are detected with the so-called ""tax"" probe. Nevertheless, the constant designation of the transcripts as ""tax"" throughout the article can be very misleading. It would be more accurate to refer to the results obtained with this probe in the text and figures as ""+strand"", or another more inclusive designation, rather than ""tax"" solely.At the beginning of the Results section we made this point clear by stating ‘In this paper,
tax is used as a proxy for plus-strand proviral expression: the
tax target sequence is present in all plus-strand transcripts.’  However, we accept that the reader may overlook this important point when reading the rest of the paper, and accordingly we have systematically replaced reference ‘
tax’ expression by ‘plus-strand’ expression in the revised manuscript. 2.    Nearly 60 to 90% of cells in all 5 clones express hbz antisense transcripts, but depending on the clone studied, the presence of +strand transcripts, as detected with the ""tax"" probe, are much more heterogeneous (<10% in clones A and D, and 50-60% in clones B & C). Given this overwhelming heterogeneity, how can the authors exclude that it is not due to variation in Tax-encoding transcripts, but solely to other viral +strand transcripts. In other words, the authors cannot exclude that levels of Tax-encoding transcripts were homogeneously low in all clones.We have addressed this point in the revised manuscript by replacing ‘
tax’ with ‘plus-strand’ (see point 1 above).  In fact, while there is a theoretical possibility that plus-strand transcripts other than
tax dominate, it is well established that
tax is the first plus-strand transcript, is most abundant, and crucially
tax expression is required for efficient expression of other plus-strand RNAs.  Also, even if
tax were uniformly low in the plus-strand-expressing cells, the single-cell heterogeneity of
tax would still be much more heterogeneous than that of
hbz.
3.   Although the authors insist on the pitfalls of qPCR to analyze single cell transcription, there have been several reports on microfluidics technology being successfully used to monitor single cell RNA expression (i.e. Moussy et al. 2017. PLoS  Biol 15(7):e2001867). The application of microfluidics on PBMCs directly isolated from patients would likely allow a more accurate assessment of the in vivo status of RNA transcripts.We agree that it is of great importance and interest to quantify HTLV-1 expression in freshly isolated PBMCs. To do this, we are now applying the smFISH technique described here to fresh PBMCs.4.   As mentioned above, given the experimental model of subcloning and culture (at the non-physiological 20% oxygen tension, which artificially modulates HTLV-1 activation, as previously published by the authors), and in the absence of immune pressure, the claim that the results presented here are relevant for in vivo situations and ""offer an explanation for the paradoxical correlations observed between the host immune response and HTLV-1 transcription"" is not warranted.Our recently published evidence (Kulkarni et al 2017, Cell Chemical Biology
24, 1–11) showed that the oxygen tension modulated plus-strand HTLV-1 transcription, but this effect was approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the variation in plus-strand abundance reported here, and there was no evidence that oxygen tension initiated plus-strand expression.5.   Since the correlation between ""transcription bursts"" and the G2/M cell cycle stage is not established for +strand ""tax"" transcripts, and pertains to <7% of cells in which hbz is detected, the claim of a relationship between viral gene bursts and cell cycle (as stated in the general conclusion and the title) does not appear justified. Therefore, the intricate array of cross analyses and statistical evaluation performed here and addressed lengthily in the discussion is not likely to reflect in vivo situations.The statistical analysis provides objective evidence of an association between transcription and cell cycle stage, and further shows that this association is independent of the other factors considered.6.    Statistical significance of the correlation between high hbz expression, hbz bursts and the G2/M stages should be directly mentioned in Fig. 5 and the corresponding text. The clones used to obtain the data provided in panel 5b are not indicated (it appears that clones A and B were used here, whereas data in 5c are mentioned in the figure legend to result from the average of clones A, B, C and D).Thank you for this useful suggestion. In the revised manuscript we have included a reference to the statistical test and significance of the association in the legend to Figure 5; it is also mentioned in the text of the Results section. The cells used in these experiments were the four
tax-competent clones: this was described in the figure legend; the legend has been modified to make it clearer.7.   Given the reservations mentioned above (an in vitro system that does not recapitulate in vivo conditions, the lack of distinction between tax versus +strand transcripts, and the lack of data on Tat and HBZ proteins), the discussion remains too speculative.As noted above, we stated in the manuscript ‘If this pattern of HTLV-1 gene expression accurately represents the pattern of expression
in vivo [...]’ and that our results ‘offer an explanation’ of certain observations
in vivo. However, we agree that it is important to remind the reader of the actual and potential differences in HTLV-1 transcription between
in vivo and
in vitro, and accordingly we have added the following sentence to the end of the Discussion, to make clear what remains hypothetical: ‘It remains to be tested how closely the transcriptional behaviour of HTLV-1 observed in these naturally-infected T-cell clones represents the transcriptional behaviour of the virus
in vivo, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We are now applying the techniques described here to quantify HTLV-1 plus- and minus-strand transcription in PBMCs both directly
ex vivo and after short-term
 in vitro incubation.’ We have also modified the concluding section of the abstract, to say ‘If so [if the
in vitro behaviour accurately represents the
in vivo behaviour], then our results offer an explanation...’ 8.    In this study, there is no assessment of the relationship between transcript and protein levels; moreover, since the half-lives of Tax and Hbz proteins in this model are not established, it is not possible to evaluate the actual timing of a potential cross-regulation between the 2 proteins. In this regard, the authors should discuss a recent paper by Baratella et al. (PLos Negl Trop Dis Jan 2017) that describes the specific accumulation of the HBZ protein in the cytoplasm of PBMCs directly isolated from TSP/HAM patients.Thank you for drawing our attention to this interesting paper by Baratella et al. In the revised manuscript we have included the following sentence in the Discussion section to refer to this work: ‘HBZ protein is frequently undetectable in fresh PBMCs, but Baratella et al.
46 reported the detection of HBZ protein in the cytoplasm of PBMCs isolated from patients with the inflammatory disease HAM/TSP.’  A detailed examination of the relationship between mRNA and protein levels is beyond the scope of the present paper. 9.    In suppl. fig 7 - there is an SEM indicated in the histogram of clone C while there was only 2 replicates, according to the figure legend. Also, in suppl.

Thank you for pointing out the inversions of colour and legend in Figures 8 and 9: these have now been corrected.  Indeed, Clone A did not fit the G2/M correlation with a high frequency of plus-strand transcripts: this point is discussed in the legend to Supplementary Figure 9.",30,11,2017,2017-11-30,PMC5645716,Research Article,29062917,NA,Single-cell heterogeneity and cell-cycle-related viral gene bursts in the human leukaemia virus HTLV-1.,2017-09-22,research-article; journal article;

Select reagents were then used as competitors for HCV entry, and to stain CD81 complexes on the surface of HEK cells. The authors found no correlation between m'ab binding sites and ability to block HCV entry, but did correlate this with the overall avidity of m'abs for cell expressed CD81. Scanning immunogold EM conducted upon plasma membranes revealed apparently distinct complexes of CD81, consistent with its organisation within the tetraspannin web. Some comments for consideration:
For the HCV entry inhibition experiments, have the authors considered that entry may be blocked by the m'abs promoting internalisation of the CD81? This may explain the apparent independence with respect to binding sites.I do not understand the statistical basis for ignoring the outliers in figure 3c. Plus experimental repeats and tests should be clarified in general.Controls are missing for the SEM studies, such as primary/secondary antibody controls and cells lacking CD81, such as HepG2.

The antibodies may be useful research tools in further defining the role of CD81 in viral entry, and the functions of tetraspanins generally. Generally, the experiments have been performed well, and the article is clearly written. However, there are some points that should be addressed by the authors:
Antibody inhibition of HCV binding is presumed to be by steric hindrance rather than blockade of specific binding sites. This could be explored more clearly using fab fragments of the antibodies that are a fraction of the size of the intact antibodies. Why was this simple and obvious procedure not performed?The hybridoma supernatants were screened against a recombinant form of the CD81 EC2 fused to MBP. It is well know that recombinant tetraspanin EC2 proteins contain a proportion of misfolded protein that could bias the selection of hybridomas. Why was screening not primarily performed against a cell line expressing native CD81?GST-CD81 EC2 was used for evaluation of HCV E2 binding. Why was this used rather than MBP-EC2?No competitive binding study was performed. This could have helped define EC2 domains recognised by the antibodies, particularly if fab fragments were used.In Fig 3c, the authors decide to ignore 2 outliers to perform the linear regression analysis. On what statistical basis were these 'outliers' defined? What are the biological properties associated with these antibodies that might make them behve in this way?The selection of antibodies for nanoscale distribution experiments was performed on the basis of high affinity. A more rational choice for this might have been one high and one low affinity antibody. Low affinity antibodies have been used by several research groups to discriminate clustered v unclustered tetraspanins at the cell surface.Although the authors detect apparently different populations of CD81 on HEK cells, it is very difficult to draw any conclusions from a single type of experiment. Does modulation of cholesterol or the actin cytoskeleton affect the populations? Does clustering of tetraspanin-associated proteisn affect distribution? Do the different populations bind EC2 differently?

The authors have not adequately mentioned the details of sample size determination. It is not clear whether the WHO definition of village (50X50km grid) apply in their sampling clusters (What is village?) and the WHO study was assessing the prevalence of filarial elephantiasis (how valid to assume the sampling technique is similar for these two diseases and climate stay constant in the last 30 years?). Did they take the clustering effect in to consideration? Their previous study
1 reported that two kebele (smallest administrative units) were selected from each districts based on reported history of lymphoedema cases collected through interviewing the woreda health officials, health providers, and village leaders 1 day before the survey. How valid is the selection of village with known cases? The potential selection bias might overestimate the prevalence.The model does not look optimally fitted. It only includes environmental factors (individual study participants characteristics were not included). Night light emissivity was assumed to capture individual participants’ characteristics as a proxy measure but not sure, if it is valid assumption. Moreover, from your previous study mean annual land surface temperature and altitude were strong environmental predictors of podoconiosis. Yet they are excluded from the current prediction model.As a follow up of no. 2 what methods you used to select the predictors finally fitted to yield a parsimonious model. A geostatistical model was used to estimate prevalence of podoconiosis in non-surveyed area but the size of non-surveyed area is not mentioned. How comparable were the surveyed and unsurveyed areas (A purposive sampling was used to select the villages rather than using the random sampling). Do you have data (on seven environmental factors) in non-surveyed areas?The study might have benefited from a multivariate Bayesian generalized linear spatial model since the proper analysis seems a multivariate Bayesian generalized linear spatial modeling (Slater 2013) which would fit both environmental and individual participant’s data. You might probably mention this in the discussion part.
 Minor concerns
The total population size was frequently cited from the FMOH even though the primary source is Central Statistical Agency.I would mention the coverage measure of prediction model (C statistics for example).

Could you also include a table to describe the estimates of the parameters in the model, or minimally a description of the direction of their influence on prevalence. How big an impact does the spatial term S(x) have on the fitted model e.g. did the covariates describe most of the spatial variability or did S(x) play a big role?Could you use different colours in Figure 2 to represent the different scales, or adjust the maps so that they are all on the same scale. It is difficult to assess the amount of uncertainty in the estimates in its current form. Similarly could you adjust the colours/scale in Figure 3. Alternatively, have you considered producing a map of the width of the confidence interval instead of separate maps of the upper and lower bounds? You mention in the discussion that the confidence intervals are very wide, but this is difficult to discern from the current maps.Please indicate the proportion of the populations in each region that are at risk of podoconiosis as well as absolute numbers.As mentioned above, have you considered other methods of validating your model predictions in addition to determining that the adopted covariance model was compatible with the data? Some assessment of model fit/model predictions is needed.Discussion:A comparison is made between the estimated podoconiosis cases obtained using this study and the number estimated in 1974. Given that the authors recognise that there’s been a dramatic change in the population since 1974, it is not appropriate to compare absolute numbers. A comparison of prevalence would be much more meaningful.I have read this submission.

Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.13252.r25742,Drakeley,Chris J.,NA,"1Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, UK",approve,"This is a comprehensive presentation of findings from a pilot trial in which Landier and colleagues show that mass drug administration had an immediate effect on falciparum parasite carriage, in both human and vector populations. In 3 of the 4 study villages, prevalence of falciparum infection remained low during the 24 month follow-up period. The effects of MDA are particularly impressive given the fluid nature of the population and relatively low level of effective coverage (especially in larger villages). MDA appeared not to affect the incidence of clinical malaria episodes when compared to the control (‘pre-MDA’) villages. However, in the control villages, early diagnosis and treatment provided by MP was associated with reductions in malaria transmission, comparable to that seen in villages with MP and MDA. The relative contribution of MDA over MP is a key question for malaria control programmes as they seek to decide whether ensuring basic diagnostics and treatment is sufficient to eliminate malaria. The data are interesting but fall short of answering this comprehensively given the small sample size - presumably this will be a focus of the main study.Abstract: It is not clear what refers to falciparum and what refers to
vivax infections. It seems from the methods section that the criterion was >10% falciparum prevalence. Also, it is not clear by what method this prevalence is assessed. What population size is village size small or large? Vector positivity presumably means sporozoite.Introduction: The evidence for the effect of treatment of the reduction of transmission is quite sparse and typically from areas with good health systems and low transmission. Context could be improved here. It might help to cite studies that show mosquito feeding experiments in SE Asia have shown that most infections come from symptomatic infections. Primaquine does not strictly sterilize infections – it has little demonstrable effect on asexual parasites.Methods: Were the numbers malaria posts proportional to population? What was the rationale for no radical cure for
P.vivax? Why was parasite prevalence was not assessed in infants? One might expect that the overall transmission effect of MDA (and MP) on parasite prevalence would also be seen in this group. Does malaria infection prevalence represent for each or for either ? Why the change in time for MDA from M12 to M9? this seems irrational and inconsistent with the rigour of the general context of the study. It does not allow similar follow up periods and confounds any potential seasonal effects.Results: How did population movement relate to coverage? Were those individuals who spent less time in villages less likely to receive MDA? What was the prevalence of infection in this group? There is a lack of spatial analysis. The authors could use the georeferenced data to estimate whether MDA coverage predicted residual parasite prevalence spatially. Similarly, it would be interesting to understand if compliance was spatially aggregated (presumably it was). Also, were AEs related to coverage? The prevalence of AEs declined after each round, but that could be related to individuals most likely to develop AEs refusing to receive additional treatment. What was the prevalence of AEs in the different rounds in those individuals who received all 3 treatments? The most informative analysis is the comparison in the control villages before MDA (so effect due to MP alone) versus after MDA (combined MDA and MP effects). The GEE model estimated that the post-MDA period was associated with 5 fold reduction in falciparum carriage. However there was a clear trend of declining falciparum prevalence during the pre-MDA period. How much of this 5-fold reduction is related to the continued reduction in transmission due to MP. “During the pre-MDA control period, individual with baseline
P. falciparum infections had a significantly increased odds of subsequent
P. falciparum carriage…” – is this related to age? To occupation? Residence?  It would be interesting to see a graph that shows temporal variation in the entomological parameters together with human prevalence and comments on the effect of seasonality.Discussion The authors argue that access to diagnosis and treatment had an important effect on transmission that was “augmented by MDA”. The design of the study and the limited number of villages does not really justify this conclusion. In the control villages, where MDA was implemented 9 months after improved access to diagnosis and treatment, there was a clear trend of decreasing transmission before MDA. It is not clear how the authors expect to quantify effectiveness of MDA, that is independent of MP, using this design. This needs to be mentioned early in the discussion as this comparison is the main question the study wants to address: the added value of MDA in area with improved access to diagnosis and treatment. Authors could discuss what additional interventions should be considered to sustain vivax transmission reduction. It might be worth speculating how malaria elimination can be delayed by not treating first trimester pregnant women and infants.We have read this submission.

The background and justification for the study are compelling, and the implications of the findings for Kenya are well articulated. That being said, certain sections would require further elaboration or clarification:  
The study purposively selects two counties with different poverty levels and degrees of urbanization, but the analysis does not exploit this or indicate whether there were any significant differences in findings.The findings report inequities in the official benefits and premium levels for civil servants and other formal sector or informal sector members. This point has been merged under the sub-section on health care providers’ reported discrimination against NHIF members, but it appears quite distinct. Indeed, if informal sector payers are paying similar premia, but are officially entitled to a more limited benefit package, this seems to be a critical design issue that will impact on their willingness to join the scheme.The discussion section is very specific to Kenya, including context-specific recommendations. While it clearly makes sense to draw out the implications for the NHIF in Kenya, it would be useful to broaden the discussion somewhat and consider policy implications for other settings. The introduction underscores the relevance of the study, given efforts in several countries to extend universal health coverage through national schemes that include voluntary insurance for the informal sector, yet the discussion does not place the findings back in this context.In the methods section, the selection of counties could be explained in more detail. Also, it would be useful to provide a summary of the characteristics of the respondents, besides whether they are current, former or potential NHIF members (age, marital status, occupation, etc).  The authors quote a health care provider in the results section, but this category of respondents is not mentioned in the methods section.

The data is well presented and provides deeper insights on the key barriers to involving the informal sector users. However, there are a few issues that the authors could consider:
Although the authors used the informal sector derived from NHIF, I feel inclusion of the fact that they are not taxed may be misleading. Perhaps qualifying it further would be usefulThe authors also note that they used grounded approach in the analysis, I presume they must have designed it first deductively be identifying areas of examination a priory. There may be need to clarify that they both used inductive and deductive approaches in the methods section. Use of grounded approaches as stated may suggest potential design that is theory driven. I think they used thematic content analysis that is was both deductive and inductive drivenIn the result section although well described and presented there are opportunities for linking the results that speak to each other. For example, inadequate and inconsistent communication by NHIF affects understanding of the NHIF registration requirements limiting desire and access to NHIF inclusion.In terms of the discrimination- can the authors clarify that the preference of provision of services to civil servants was reported in public health sector or private sector? This is important for readers to make judgment of the results and its implications for making changes.The results presented are against a backdrop of challenging context where public sector providers have had several industrial strikes and changes in managing health care in devolve structures, a mention of this background would be useful to the readers as they may explain some of the result around variance of services on paper versus those that are provided.The authors make a recommendation on subsides for that are tax funded, can they also provide a rider that targeting mechanism can be tricky and may require investment to ensure subside reach the targeted communities.

First, it provides a solid example of how to report the process and outcomes of community engagement (CE) strategies in global health and global development. Despite an improved appreciation of community engagement overall, there are still very few examples of competent reports of CE strategies in the literature. This has limited the empirical footprint of CE and hampered important learning for funders, implementation partners, researchers and a wide range of review panels. Second, although only partially successful in this case, the paper makes an important effort to link CE activities with relevant outcomes of interest - i.e., participation rates in MDA. “Partial success”, in this case, has a great deal to do with the lack of well-developed models or comparators, so although there are points that could certainly be elaborated and clarified, the paper provides a concrete example that can be constructively critiqued and built upon, which is a fundamentally important contribution to the literature in itself. Third, malaria elimination has become a dominant focus in malaria research and intervention. Funders and implementation partners have recognized the importance of CE as a key element of MDA and other elimination strategies, but still struggle to understand the unique value proposition of CE and how best to integrate it into their investments. This paper contributes to a growing body of knowledge that will help to address these important upstream challenges in global health. A key strength of the paper lies in how explicitly it attempts to account for the elements of the CE process. There are important gaps (see below), but overall the paper provides a vivid and useful account of what was done, if slightly less detail about the rationales, outcomes and implications.A weakness of the paper, as suggested above, is the relative lack of attention to the rationales for the various decisions about CE mechanisms - i.e., why, precisely, were the various approaches selected - and to the outcomes and implications of each of these decisions/activities/mechanisms. One of the important gaps in the CE literature is program theory, i.e., coherent accounts of configurations of context + mechanisms + outcomes that can provide us with a better understanding of how CE actually works in any specific context of application. The paper succeeds, in my view, by virtue of providing a relatively rich description of the CE activities, but further elaboration on the rationales, outcomes and implications, in addition to description of some of the activities/mechanisms, would have made the paper much stronger. (See detailed comments, below)Another weakness of the paper, which might be easily remedied, is that the discussion section is very limited and does not deal very effectively with the findings reported in the paper. If there is any scope of revision of the paper, I would suggest that some of the detailed comments, below, might provide a useful guide for what informed readers might find most helpful in terms of elaboration. Since each of these points arises from a comment on something in the paper it should be feasible, and not onerous, for the authors to simply expand the discussion section of the paper to share some of their thoughts and reflections more explicitly on these, and perhaps other, points.  Specific Comments 
Page 3, column 1, 5
th paragraph: “An inclusive definition of community engagement was adopted…” This is a good example of how the framing and reporting of CE is limited primarily to CE
mechanisms or
activities. It would have been extremely helpful, especially at the outset of the paper, to have some elaboration of the goals and rationales lying behind these definitions. This would also have provided some conceptual space for the authors to report on other relevant observations.Page 4, column 1, 2

Does CE need to focus more on the provision of information? More on measuring understanding? Etc.Page 4, column 1, last line: “…fears and misconceptions…” What were these fears and misconceptions?

nd column, last sentence: “Singing, chanting and acting was (sic) also popular as this (sic) was entertaining and pleasurable for both children and their parents. Again, what was the intended purpose of these activities? How should the pleasure of children and parents be interpreted in term of the operating logic of the CE strategy?Page 5, 1
st full paragraph, last sentence: “This knowledge allowed us to plan community based events which were better attended when they did not conflict with villager commitments to their land, religious ceremonies or holidays.” Again, what were these insights? How, specifically, were they addressed—i.e., what kinds of revisions and refinements to the design of the CE strategy did these insights lead to?Page 6, 1
st paragraph, second last sentence: “The study team lived with the villagers during intensive MDA and survey days.” Although I understand this point both from a cultural and pragmatic perspective, given the locations of the study, this seems like quite a profound point in terms of our understanding of “engagement”. What did the workers learn? What were the hosts experiences? Even if these aren’t reported in a comprehensive way, are their key insights or lessons that might help readers gain better understanding of CE, especially the relational aspects?Page 6, column 2, 4

Unfortunately, the possible meaning(s) is not self-evident here and seems quite important in terms of the overall goals of the CE strategy.Page 7, first paragraph, line 3: “…signals good will…” What are the implications of signaling good will here? Is this an explicit goal of CE, is it an instrumental goal? Or an end itself for CE?Page 7, column 1, 4
th full paragraph, last sentence: “…we think that some formative research and more creative methods such as science theatres could be used in addition to the more traditional methods of engagement.” Why, what goals would these serve? What outcomes would they produce?  Recommendations As I hope my specific comments make clear, there are some missed opportunities in the paper to provide some elaboration on several quite important issues. However, given the current state of the literature I think the paper represents an solid and important attempt to build our understanding of CE, especially in such an important global health context—MDAs in malaria elimination—and therefore I would recommend indexing the paper. In terms of what revisions are necessary, I think this sits somewhere between minor revisions and major revisions. One approach, as I have outlined above, would be for the authors to pick up on some, or all, of my detailed comments, above and incorporate them into a more robust discussion section. As it stands, the discussion is extremely lean and focuses primarily on other work. Some or most of this other work would make more sense as
background and would make way for the authors to provide more detailed reflection on their findings and experiences. There are probably 4-5 main themes in my specific comments and these might offer a useful framing for the kinds of insights and elaboration that would have most value for an informed reader.I have read this submission.

The article describes the community engagement activities, the challenges and some of the steps taken to overcome these challenges. Honest reports of community engagement are a valuable resource for other practitioners. This article reports engagement in a particularly challenging context with geographical, social and political difficulties, so highlights some of the complications in engagement. The detailed account of engagement activities also provides useful ideas and learning for other engagement practitioners (e.g. the use of a quiz to check understanding), and there are nice examples of making engagement culturally appropriate (e.g. using of a rock rather than iceberg metaphor to describe malaria levels). I also welcome inclusion of an article that is based on team reflections rather than additional data collection; reflection is an essential part of good research and engagement practice, and useful lessons can be missed without openness to this kind of article. A few areas might be suggested to further deepen the analysis: It would be interesting to learn more about variations between the villages, and about whether particular engagement strategies were more effective in some contexts than others. The authors note that it was not possible to determine a relationship between engagement and coverage or to assess the impact of different activities. However, additional descriptions of any variation in activities between sites and reasons for this might be helpful, together with reflections on potential reasons for variations in coverage and effectiveness of CE. For example, the surveys suggested that people did not participate due to inadequate understanding of MDA, indicating limitations of the CE. It would be interesting to reflect on the extent to which this involves limited implementation of CE (e.g. due to geographical barriers), or ineffectiveness of CE that was conducted (e.g. due to problems with translation), and how these constrains varied between villages. Some aspects of variation are indicated, but could perhaps be brought together more explicitly. The authors and engagement team are described as local. Local is a word that can be interpreted in different ways, so it would be interesting to reflect on their position and to give more detail on their relationship to communities. Were they local in the sense of coming from these communities, or from the region, and were they considered as local by the communities? Relationships may be affected by similarity or difference in terms of social status, education, etc., as well as residence or place of birth. Another area for further reflection relates to the idea of engagement as a two-way process that involves seeking feedback from communities. The focus of engagement appears to have been on informing communities about MDA to promote high coverage. It may be useful to say more about any aims or strategies around eliciting community feedback on the intervention, and the effects of such strategies. While the article is well written, occasionally suggestions are made about what approach should be taken when it is not fully clear what was actually done or what challenges arose (e.g. in relation to education materials and unpredictability in the results section). It may might be useful to clearly separate lessons and recommendations from descriptions of what happened. It may also be useful to summarise key lessons in a box in the discussion or conclusions – there are valuable suggestions and a box would help to ensure that lessons are seen by busy readers. To support learning, it would also be helpful to have a little more explanation and detail on some of the points mentioned in the results, for example, establishing a malaria post in a way that enabled ownership – ownership is a common requirement and challenge, so it would be interesting to know how it was achieved. Some lessons are fairly standard recommendations for engagement with development interventions and widely advocated, such as the need for adequate time and flexibility. Do the authors have any reflections on why these essential resources and features of engagement approaches are not always followed, or on potential constraints to adoption of this advice? What systems or approaches can help to ensure, for example, that teams are flexible? Consideration of other literature in the discussion section notes other CE programmes that have followed a similar approach. It would be useful to extend consideration of the literature to see whether other articles have reflected on the strengths and weaknesses of the different CE activities (such as individual or community compensation), to draw out wider lessons on advantages and challenges. These comments do not affect the value or conclusions of the article; they are areas of further interest for the authors to consider rather than requirements for re-writing.

The study is based on the effect of UDCA through different mechanisms like protection of cholangiocytes against cytotoxicity of hydrophobic bile acids, reduction of bile acid cytotoxicity of bile and, possibly, decrease of the concentration of hydrophobic bile acids in the cholangiocytes, stimulation of hepatobiliary secretion, putatively via Ca(2+)- and protein kinase C-alpha-dependent mechanisms and/or activation of p38(MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) resulting in insertion of transporter molecules (e.g., bile salt export pump, BSEP, and conjugate export pump, MRP2) into the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte, protection of hepatocytes against bile acid-induced apoptosis, involving inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MMPT), and possibly, stimulation of a survival pathway.

However, comparison of phenotypic expression from this study (i.e. mortality rates from WHO bio-assay), with results obtained from other datasets elsewhere, may be constrained. This is because mortality rates have been shown to vary with the age of mosquito and the addition of 2-day old samples, will be a confounding factor. It is unclear if the mosquito samples evaluated in Elibou (

Please see comments to author.Abstract: In the method paragraph it said that three to five days old mosquitoes were used for the bioassays. Which contradict what is mentioned in
the Methods-WHO diagnostic bioassays part where it is mentioned that two to five day old mosquitoes were used. It is confusing. Give the right age of mosquitoes used for the bioassays. If it was two to five days mosquitoes used, explained why, as the WHO procedure you have cited recommends to use three to five days old mosquitoes. I do not know which is right.Methods: In Elibou untested mosquito were used for molecular analysis, and in Tiassalé surviving mosquito to deltamethrim exposure were used. In Elibou the frequency of 1014F has not been investigated, there is a specific reason for that? It is known that the 1014F is linked to 1575Y. The data of the 1014F should be interesting. Providing this data should be important.Table1: in this table presenting the results the frequencies of the 1575Y mutation in Tiassalé (n= 92) and Elibou (n= 44), I am a bit confused. 110 untested mosquitoes from Elibou were used for molecular. Why in the table the total number of mosquitoes from Elibou was only 44? These mosquitoes are from those surviving deltamethrim exposure or are subset of the 110 untested mosquitoes used for molecular form and species identification. Of the most recent paper (
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25766412), reporting the presence of the 1575Y mutation in Tengrela area in the Burkina Faso, of the closest area from Côte d’Ivoire where this mutation is reported with a frequency around 0.25- is not cited anywhere in the paper.

It builds on a number of studies which assessed spatial structure of parasites in other locations on a smaller scale, and adds useful information to these other studies. I have a few comments and suggestions:
A number of different tests and analyses were conducted, which becomes slightly confusing. It would be helpful to have a list or table briefly indicating what each analysis is testing for.The authors mention this is an area of high transmission intensity – it would be interesting to additionally present a measure of malaria prevalence in the schools and roughly how much this varied across the area. Also, was there any difference in population structure in lower versus higher transmission areas? One might hypothesise that there could be.When an infection contained mixed parasite genotypes, the authors analysed only the dominant genotype. This is fine, but did they also consider using a method such as the REAL McCOIL
1? This is a statistical method for estimating SNP frequencies, using data from mixed infections, which avoids discarding the additional information available from minority genotypes. This might make quite a difference in this area of higher transmission, where presumably a fairly high proportion of infections contain more than one parasite population. I am not sure whether the sample sizes would be sufficient to run this method for each school, and thus from there complete the other analyses, but it would be worth investigating.In the methods section, could the authors add some more detail on this analysis, or provide a reference? “We then ran a purely spatial analysis based on a normal probability distribution model and located geographical regions with clusters of high PC scores.” I am not sure how easily others could reproduce it from its current description.The analysis looking at spatial barriers makes sense, but I wonder if the authors considered computing travel distance, and thus using more a priori information on potential barriers? Over these distances, presumably human movement may be more important than vector movement in distributing parasites. Although given the lack of spatial barriers identified by the pixel-based analysis, perhaps travel distance would be unlikely to show any different result.This section in the discussion: “Of the 83 SNPs examined, we identified 18 SNPs that had statistically significant variations in allele frequencies among schools from the logistic regression analysis. Although none of these 18 SNPs were significant after accounting for multiple testing, there was a clear excess of statistically significant SNPs, suggesting that the variations seen were not simply due to random chance.” I found rather confusing.

Also, was there any difference in population structure in lower versus higher transmission areas? One might hypothesise that there could be.A map of the study region showing parasite prevalence for each school has been added as supplementary figure 1. The following accompanying text has been added to explain the observation from the map. “Variation in parasite prevalence was observed in the region, with areas north and west of Lake Victoria having higher infection prevalence than areas south and east of the lake (Supplementary Figure 1).”No differences in population structure were observed in lower versus higher transmission areas, and a statement to this effect has been included in the results section under ‘P. falciparum population genetics’: “At the sub-national level, we were unable to resolve the parasite population into distinct sub-populations based on PCA, and there was no difference in population structure in lower versus higher transmission intensity areas.”When an infection contained mixed parasite genotypes, the authors analysed only the dominant genotype. This is fine, but did they also consider using a method such as the REAL McCOIL
1? This is a statistical method for estimating SNP frequencies, using data from mixed infections, which avoids discarding the additional information available from minority genotypes.

I am not sure whether the sample sizes would be sufficient to run this method for each school, and thus from there complete the other analyses, but it would be worth investigating.Although THE REAL McCOIL seems to be robust at estimating complexity of infections and allele frequencies in samples with mixed infections, its focused mainly on determining SNP frequencies. For this reason, THE REAL McCOIL requires parasites to be initially assigned into distinct populations. We do not believe that this statistical method is appropriate in our case because we wanted to focus our analyses on individual parasite genotypes and their relatedness in pairwise analyses, to determine whether we can use genetic relatedness at this level to identify distinct parasite populations, and then use measures of spatial autocorrelation to identify the location and size of any parasite sub-populations.In the methods section, could the authors add some more detail on this analysis, or provide a reference? “We then ran a purely spatial analysis based on a normal probability distribution model and located geographical regions with clusters of high PC scores.” I am not sure how easily others could reproduce it from its current description.Additional information has been added to better explain the analysis. A reference has also been added. The additional text reads as follows: “We used the latitude/longitude coordinates to specify feature (sample) locations and the PC scores to represent feature attributes (parasite genotypes), and ran a purely spatial, retrospective analysis based on a normal probability distribution model implemented in SaTScan software
1. We identified geographical regions with clusters containing parasite genotypes associated with high PC scores.”The analysis looking at spatial barriers makes sense, but I wonder if the authors considered computing travel distance, and thus using more a priori information on potential barriers? Over these distances, presumably human movement may be more important than vector movement in distributing parasites. Although given the lack of spatial barriers identified by the pixel-based analysis, perhaps travel distance would be unlikely to show any different result.Travel distance will add more information and help to draw more concrete conclusions. Such information can be derived from travel history or mobile phone data. However, we did not have this data at the time of analysis and thus did not include it. We have however, recommended this as a logical next step in any future analysis of parasite gene flow when using genetic data to analyse parasite movement. We have included a sentence in the discussion recommending this that reads as follows:“Additional analyses of samples from other regions of the country that experience malaria transmission such as coast, eastern and north eastern provinces are recommended. Furthermore, over longer distances human movement becomes more important than mosquito movement in distributing parasites and therefore will need to be taken into consideration when analysing parasite genetic relatedness across large spatial scales. Information on travel distance can be obtained from travel history, or more objectively from mobile phone data, and can be used to track human movement between sources and sinks of parasite transmission. Concordance between spatial parasite genetic relatedness and human movement will further support our hypothesis of high parasite movement and mixing.”This section in the discussion: “Of the 83 SNPs examined, we identified 18 SNPs that had statistically significant variations in allele frequencies among schools from the logistic regression analysis. Although none of these 18 SNPs were significant after accounting for multiple testing, there was a clear excess of statistically significant SNPs, suggesting that the variations seen were not simply due to random chance.” I found rather confusing. If I read it correctly, it suggests that after multiple testing, the differences in frequencies were not significant, and could be due to random chance?The statement has been clarified as follows: ""Of the 83 SNPs examined, we identified 18 SNPs that had statistically significant variations in allele frequencies among schools from the logistic regression analysis, although none of these 18 SNPs were significant after accounting for multiple testing. These findings suggest that although we were not sufficiently powered to distinguish any individual SNPs as likely to be significant beyond a Bonferroni correction, on the other hand the fact that 18 SNPs showed a value of p<0.05 when only 4 would be expected by chance suggests that there may be some genuine differences in frequency within the group of SNPs."" I found this sentence very interesting: “In that previous study, however, we noted that the gradient between spatial separation and genetic relatedness was non-linear, and became less steep with distance such that past 10km there was little differentiation.”Could the authors elaborate on possible hypotheses for this observation? (or summarise from the previous paper if already included there). The following statement has been added to bring out the hypothesis of high parasite mixing drawn from the previous study. That study has also been referenced: ""This observation was hypothesized to be as a result of the rapid parasite movement and mixing observed within the study sites, with no geographical areas acting as spatial barriers to parasite movement, combined with a process operating at micro-geographical scales that results in a selection disadvantage to the autochthonous parasite population. In theory, the acquisition of parasite genotype-specific immunity or the impact of superinfection of incoming parasite types displacing existing parasites could meet these criteria.""",29,8,2017,2017-8-29,PMC5527688,Research Article,28944299,NA,Geographic-genetic analysis of Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations from surveys of primary school children in Western Kenya.,2017-09-05,research-article; journal article;

Our previous study showed no population structure when SNPs in EBA175 and AMA1 were analysed, we therefore did not type and analyse separately SNPs in antigenic genes for the present study.”The author may use a wider range colour coding for Figures 3 and 5 – the current colour scheme is difficult to see the differences.Due to the high level of similarity among the parasite genotypes analysed, most of the PC scores are quite similar in value, and this would be reflected in any continuous colour scheme chosen. Furthermore, we plotted the mean PC score per school, which further reduced the variability of the individual data points. The colour range shown in the figures is therefore more a factor or the PC values, rather than the specific colours used.Additional methods such as Migrate-n may provide further evidence on the directionality of parasite movements.Although Migrate-N is a useful software for inferring population size and migration rates, it seems to work best when parasites are grouped into distinct populations prior to estimating these parameters. Our analysis focused on using genetic relatedness and measures of spatial autocorrelation to identify population structure. Once such structure has been identified then Migrate-N could be used to determine migration rates between these different populations. Unfortunately, we did not find strong evidence for population structure among parasites in the western Kenya region, thus this analysis of gene flow may be less useful in this case. However, we have noted in the conclusion paragraph that such software is available and can be used to study gene flow, once distinct populations have been identified.The statement in the conclusion paragraph reads as follows:“We have also shown that directionality of parasite migration can be inferred based on genetic relatedness, and gene flow models, e.g. as implemented in migrate-n software, can be used to determine the migration rates within the region, although such models are likely to prove more useful if distinct parasite populations exist and can be identified within the region.”",29,8,2017,2017-8-29,PMC5527688,Research Article,28944299,NA,Geographic-genetic analysis of Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations from surveys of primary school children in Western Kenya.,2017-09-05,research-article; journal article;

The following points warrant close consideration.
Although the dietary level of BA supplementation employed is in line with what is often used in animal models, the changes in bile acid pool and composition that ensue when the amount of dietary BA is set at 0.5% w/w are beyond extreme and result in shifts in cholesterol metabolism at multiple levels that would never occur in humans taking approved doses of any specific BA. At a dietary level of 0.5%,  the dose used in these studies was the equivalent of around 800 mg/day /kg bw which far exceeds what most human subjects taking oral BAs consume during a 24 hour period.  When BA pool size and composition change in extreme ways there are invariably marked shifts in intestinal cholesterol absorption and this in turn has a major impact on the amount of chylomicron cholesterol reaching the liver from the small intestine (and therefore in the amounts of unesterified chol –UC—becoming subsequently trapped in the late /E/L compartment when NPC1 or NPC2 are mutated).

et al. (2003)
1 showing how a range of BAs including UDCA and CA  (added to the diet at a level of 0.5%) affect intestinal cholesterol absorption in a normal mouse model (see Fig 3 in particular). While a BA pool enriched with UDCA drives down intestinal cholesterol absorption, the opposite effect occurs with CA. Another example illustrating how BA pool size and composition are major determinants of cholesterol absorption is seen in a study by Schwarz
et al. (1998)
2 –see solid histograms for WT mice given hyodeoxycholic acid vs cholic acid  in Fig 5. Anyone who knows about the properties of CA and who also understands the biochemical consequences of NPC1 deficiency would view the effects of CA described in the current report as “totally predictable” especially given the massive dose that was fed to the mice. It would have been better to use two different doses of UDCA.The bottom line in all this is that the differing impacts on liver “health” of UDCA vs CA supplementation in NPC1
-/- mice shown here are likely fully explainable on the basis of major differences in the amount of intestinally derived cholesterol  trapped in the livers of the KOs given these two particular BAs. Although no data are presented for hepatic total chol concs (mg/g), one might predict from other studies in the NPC1 mouse model that a several fold greater level of unesterified chol (UC) would be seen in the livers of the CA supplemented mice vs those given UDCA. There is no question that it is the cytotoxic effects of the entrapped UC in all organs, especially the liver, that has the most damaging impact in NPC1 (or NPC2) dysfunction. While it is recognized that this is a preliminary report, it is essential that more informed conclusions be reached about what UDCA supplementation might conceivably be doing in the human NPC1-deficient liver. To achieve this, definitely the liver UC and EC concentrations in these mice, along with their plasma/serum ALT and AST levels should be measured. Such measurements  are needed if these mouse model experiments are to provide any credible guide as to how UDCA supplementation in human NPC1 patients might be acting. The benefit most likely has nothing to do with putative improvement in functionality of the P450 detoxification system.As it is currently written, this report will likely attract criticism because of its lack of acknowledgement of  significant published work documenting the beneficial impact of other types of treatment modalities for improving liver function in NPC1 deficiency,  mostly based on
in vivo experiments using primarily the NPC1
-/- mouse model. In 2007 Beltroy
et al. showed that the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, given  in the diet from the time of weaning, at doses far below those of other treatments (ie 20 or less mg /day/kg bw), reduced hepatomegaly and lowered liver cholesterol content (nearly all UC) by almost 50% (Fig 4)
3. The benefit of ezetimibe in this disease is largely in the liver. After that, a series of definitive publications from a number of labs attesting the potency of subcutaneously administered 2HPBCD in diminishing hepatic UC content and markedly improving liver function tests (and increasing lifespan) in NPC1 mouse models helped establish this agent as one of great potential for managing multisystem disease in NPC1 deficiency

 Although this preliminary report will be of interest to many working in the field of NPCD management, it should not generate the impression that UDCA has a clear potential to become a treatment modality for liver disease in NPCD patients. Citation of the earlier papers noted above  documenting the decisive benefits of ezetimibe and 2HPBCD in  NPC1 mice will allow readers to gain a better perspective of what these initial data in the UDCA treated NPC1 mouse model are telling us.I have read this submission.

et al entitled
“Differential response of the liver to bile acid treatment in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick disease type C” reports the effect of bile acid treatment on the liver pathology in a mouse model of NPC disease. Although, NPC is primarily considered a neurodegenerative disease, defects in systemic organs including liver have been seen in many patients. The authors previously reported suppression of cytochrome P450 detoxification system in the liver of NPC mice and limited set of human samples. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are also involved in the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol. The authors hypothesize that exogenously supplied bile acid could potentially alleviate liver disease in NPC. In the study, they used a mouse model to test the hypothesis. The study comes from a lab that holds expertise in NPC and actively advancing the NPC research since last many years. The study was elegantly designed, results are clearly presented and the manuscript is well written and discussed. The conclusions drawn are based on the results reported. The manuscript is suitable to be published in the current form, however if the authors addressed the following comments, it would further enhance the quality of this publication.  
In NPC, many systemic organs including liver show elevated inflammation. One would expect decreased cholesterol burden after UDCA treatment would reduce infiltration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. It would be nice to have results of a couple of inflammatory marker analysis included in the liver of UDCA treated mice. In addition, it would also be interesting to see how liver enzymes (such as ALT & AST) in mice respond to UDCA treatment.In a separate manuscript (submitted for peer review, ref #10), the authors report the clinical data of four NPC patients treated with bile acid.  The results presented in ref#10 show significant improvement in the liver function in UDCA-treated patients. The submission is a useful extension of this study and shows how findings in an animal model translate to clinics. I would have preferred if both manuscripts were combined. This would allow readers to have a better understanding of the effect of bile acid treatment in NPC in the mouse model as well as in clinics without going through two separate publications.  Nevertheless, this manuscript on its own reports interesting findings.

et al. presents a comparative genomics analysis to identify male accessory gland proteins in
Glossina species. The paper is an ""
in silico"" exploration of the MAG repertoire of
Glossina, and has the merit to open the road to further investigation on these important reproductive proteins and their functions. However I think that the authors should give the right relevance to their results, which are, in a sense, quite preliminary, but presented, in my opinion, with too much emphasis. First of all the authors have to clarify the aim of the work, especially in the context of vector control. Although it is true that a deep understanding of ACPS in
Glossina can be useful for limit fertility of
Glossina species and thus control their spread (these proteins have important roles in female post-mating behaviour, such as single mating, storing and sustaining viability of sperms etc.), I think that ACPS do not necessarily have a realistic connection with the peculiar post-mating characteristic of the reproductive cycle of
Glossina (e.g. absence of eggs deposition). Since this point is recurrently discussed and emphasized in the paper, I suggest the author either to better explain how the ACPS can have a role on the origin of this particular life cycle, or to eliminate this point which, otherwise, remains quite speculative. It is important that authors stress the importance that their work should be completed in the future by RNAseq of male accessory glands and testis of
Glossina. This because some rapidly evolving ACPS could escape
in silico investigation, as they could be
Glossina-specific and not corresponding to any ortholog, or simply because they do not bear a well-known protein domain. Species-specific proteins can not be obtained by a comparative genomic approach alone, so that RNA analysis is required to reveal (probably) the most important, peculiar ACPS in this important vector. Finally, I would be very cautious in assigning positive selection to genes with dN/dS>1, since a wider analysis including more closely related taxa (and data on their intra-specific variability) should be performed. However, based on the dN/dS estimation here provided, I think that the authors should just argue about ""possible signatures of positive selection"" on these genes.I have read this submission.

It highlights that
data sharing requires dedicated infrastructure, including relevant standards and standard-aware toolsdesigning this infrastructure and the associated policies requires engagement with all relevant stakeholdersdeveloping the above takes time and requires stable funding, including for the stakeholders involvedbuy-in from stakeholders additionally requires significant cultural changes within the research and policy ecosystem in terms of how data sharing and the reuse of shared data and tools are valued (especially in epidemiology, but also beyond). None of these points are particularly new, but spelling them out on the basis of a concrete example like WWARN and enriching them with sound bites — e.g. “Seven years ago, ""data sharing"" was a swear word.” — is useful both for conversations within a given field (in this case epidemiology) and across fields. The main strength of the paper lies in weaving in the often-neglected concept of equity, e.g. by giving voice to representatives from malaria-endemic countries (i.e. mostly in lower and middle income settings) and by discussing
the need for capacity building in such countries in terms of analyzing and otherwise utilizing data pooled across multiple countriesthe various direct and indirect interactions between single-country and multi-country studiesthe role of mediators like the World Health Organizationthe role of WWARN study sections as well assome generic and specific inequalities in research funding, publishing and assessment. The three main sources of the information presented are
a set of documents from WWARN and its partners as well as individuals involveda set of interviews with individuals who are or have been involved with WWARN internally or externallya witness seminar that brought some of those individuals together to discuss themes emerging from preliminary analysis of the documents and the set of individual interviews. Basically none of these key sources have been shared (for justified privacy reasons), which naturally limits the reproducibility of the study. However, the authors document their sources' metadata in sufficient detail to allow the reader to follow and evaluate the logic of the overall narrative as well as some of its highlighted details, e.g. the differences of perspectives of the different stakeholders, and the change of focus of the network from policy-oriented to research-oriented. The study was qualitative in nature, so there is basically no statistical analysis. It also looked at the WWARN case study almost in isolation, which limits the generalizability of the conclusions in principle, but as WWARN's approach itself is now being generalized to other epidemiological use cases in the framework of the newly established Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO, a WWARN umbrella), this provides fertile ground for testing the validity of the paper's conclusions in other epidemiological contexts like schistosomiasis, Ebola and visceral leishmaniasis. Overall, I found the paper well written, and in the few cases where I found something that would benefit from corrections, additions or clarification, I left a comment as part of my annotations of the paper, which are accessible via
https://via.hypothes.is/https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/2-63/v1 . None of these would preclude approval here in Wellcome Open Research, but I would still like to encourage the authors to address them in a revised version of the manuscript. One point I did not mention in my annotations is the lack of visuals. While not essential, it would have been useful to have some visual representation of the kinds of data that are now shared through WWARN/ IDDO, as well as of the way(s) in which they were shared (privately or more broadly) before WWARN, over the course of WWARN development and now through the WWARN/ IDDO system. This can help the reader, but it can also help to attract new readers from within or near the paper's target group of ""researchers who share data, or are contemplating doing so"".

The methods are clearly presented and the measures appear to have captured relevant aspects of rural life. The analyses are appropriate. The authors are to be congratulated for conducting such a rigorous study. I only have minor comments for the authors to consider.  
The term ‘leisure’ does not seem fully appropriate for this setting, where most of the ‘leisure’ activities are social obligations which people need to fulfill in order to maintain bonds of reciprocity. The domain is extremely important, but perhaps ‘social activities’ would be a more accurate descriptor.It is very interesting that participation in activities did not distinguish cases and the comparison participants, but only level of difficulty in engaging in those activities. This underlines the importance of using measures that capture level of difficulty as well as participation, a point which might be worth emphasizing.One of the most interesting findings is that improvement in visual acuity was not associated with improved capacity to carry out activities without difficulty or needing assistance. I was not clear why you used a different type of analysis to look at the effect of pain (and not the same as the analysis used for recurrence of trichiasis). I also thought this could be an area where you might want to recommend further study, for example, to explore how depression might mediate some of the disability associated with pain (and may not be immediately reversible when pain is alleviated + may cause additional suffering and disability) – comorbid depression is common in most chronic disorders, especially when associated with pain, and has been shown to contribute to a greater proportion of disability than the physical health condition.There were a lot of statistical comparisons and so the chance of type 1 error might need to be mentioned, although the consistent pattern of associations was convincing.There is a typo – page 16, column 2, para 2, half-way down – ‘impend’ should be ‘impede’.  I have read this submission.

Please kindly see below the point by point response we have given to each of your comments. 1) We agree with your comment that the leisure activities category consists of mostly social activities. However, “Leisure activities” is the term used in the ‘Stylised Activity List’ tool developed for the World Bank Living Standard Measurement Survey (the tool we used to collect the data) to categorise those activities.We have amended the “Leisure activities” term into “Leisure/Social activities” wherever this occurred throughout the manuscript to address this comment. 2) Thank you for pointing this out. We completely agree. We have added the following sentence on page 16, first column, paragraph 2, line 7.“This implies that measuring participation alone would not capture the negative effects of trachoma and other NTDs on functioning and daily living, and tools that can capture the level of difficulty and amount of assistance required in executing an activity should be used”. 3) The aim of the pain data analysis was to show the effect of trichiasis surgery on alleviating pain, and the effect of this on daily living. Our data showed that TT surgery significantly reduces pain, and even where there was pain after trichiasis surgery, the frequency of that pain was reduced significantly after trichiasis surgery, which in turn has a positive effect on sleep and participation in productive and social activities. This is the reason why we do not want to analyse the pain data as binary (was it present? YES/NO) as we did for the recurrence data, but rather as ordered categorical data.If we clearly understood your point on depression and pain, our data suggest that surgery alleviates ocular pain markedly, which might also suggest pain associated depression might be relieved. However, we agree that further studies are needed to elicit this association, and have discussed what you have mentioned in your comment. We have included the following sentences on page 17, first column, at the end of the first paragraph.  “Chronic pain may lead to depression and other mental disorders. Alleviating the ocular pain through surgery might also have a positive effect in improving mental health. Further studies are needed to explore the effect of trachomatous trichiasis and its surgical management on mental health of affected individuals”.   4) We have included the following sentence on page 17, first column, at the end of paragraph 2.“Type I error is possible from multiple comparisons”. 5) Thank you for picking this up.

We agree with this and had indicated this to be a limitation of the study in the last paragraph of the discussion:
“The interviewers were not masked to the trichiasis status of the participants. We cannot exclude the possibility of response bias”.
We agree with the suggestion that interviewing both the cases and comparison groups in the health facilities with interviewers conducting the interview behind a screen would have reduced this risk of bias. However, this would not have been a practical option and we think would not have been culturally acceptable in this context. The comparison groups were recruited and followed at their homes while the cases were recruited at a health facility for the following two reason.Firstly, this study was part of a larger, previously reported study where the household economic welfare of trichiasis cases and health controls (comparison participants) was compared and studied. Three methods were used to measure household economic welfare: (a) Collecting data on a broad set of asset-based wealth indicators and then relative household economic poverty was determined by principal component analysis (PCA, (b) Self-rated wealth, and (c) Peer-rated wealth.  Most of the asset based wealth indicator data needs to be collected through observation which requires the data collectors to go to the houses of the cases and comparison participants at baseline and interacting with them which again might create a chance for the data collectors to recognise some of the participants from their answers even in an interview done behind a screen. In addition, the peer rated wealth data was collected through interviewing three peers of both the cases and the comparison participants, which again required visiting the villages of all participants.Secondly, bringing the comparison groups to a health facility both at baseline and follow-up would have been logistically difficult. Trichiasis cases were mainly motivated to come to the health facility to receive surgical management for their trichiasis and for subsequent surgical follow-ups, while the comparison groups would not have such motivation.Thank you again for reviewing our manuscript.",27,10,2017,2017-10-27,PMC5686479,Research Article,29181451,NA,Impact of trichiasis surgery on daily living: A longitudinal study in Ethiopia.,2017-08-22,research-article; journal article;

A genome-wide association study using the UK Biobank first release allowed the identification of 235 SNPs associated with estimated heel BMD (eBMD) using quantitative ultrasound. These SNPs were then used as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses which led the authors to conclude that an elevated eBMD is causally associated with higher risk of T2D and CHD. The article helps to answer an interesting question using the latest Mendelian randomization methods and recent sources of publicly available genetic data. The article is well organized and clearly written. The authors performed several analyses to ensure the robustness of the findings. In the conclusions, the authors suggest that BMD is directly causal for T2D and CHD, which is a simplified interpretation of the findings. It is plausible that variants affecting bone mineral density do so through biological pathways themselves responsible for the effect on T2D and CHD risk (i.e. osteocalcin leading to insulin resistance, as mentioned by the authors in the discussion). In other words, factors leading to elevated BMD could be causing T2D and CHD rather than BMD itself. Only certain pathways might be involved, especially considering that the overall effect is weak and in the opposite direction for an important proportion of the 235 variants. As noted by the authors, a parallel can be made with the decreased risk of CAD with increasing height. In that case, it seems even more plausible that factors leading to increase height are responsible for the association rather than height itself. For these reasons, we believe that the conclusions should be revised to take into account this interpretation.  MR associations remain weakly significant and many hypotheses have been tested, the authors should also take this into account in their conclusion. We suggest also testing height and waist-to-hip ratio as potential risk factors associated with the eBMD genetic instrument (i.e. in Table 2). This statement in the Discussion should be revised: “However, the lack of a negative association of CHD SNPs with eBMD argues against the presence of CHD causally impacting on eBMD, and thus the discrepancy between the observational analysis and MR findings warrants further investigation.” This does not take into account the possibility that it is the CHD event that leads participants to decrease activity, such that no genetic association would be observed in individuals free of CHD, even if genetically predisposed. We also have a few minor suggestions:
Characteristics of the UK Biobank participants included in the analysis (first genotyping release) should be described in Table 1 (n=116,501) in addition to the whole UK Biobank European population (n=457,395).In the Results section, it would be more logical to present the eBMD GWAS results before the results of the association between eBMD and T2D/CHD, and invert Figure 2 and 3.We suggest replacing the term ""contribute"" by ""associated"" in the header of Table 2.A figure showing the association in terms of loci (instead of rs numbers only) would be interesting to get a better idea of the pathways involved. We suggest for example using only the stronger SNPs (p-value < 5X10
-20) and plotting the effect on eBMD vs the effect on T2D and CHD.It should be mentioned in the limitations that applicability to non-European ethnic groups remains uncertain as mostly European studies were used in the analysis.In the Conclusions section, the word “casual” should read “causal”.   In the Supplementary Material:
The font of axes labels in Supplementary Figures 1, 2 and 4 should be increased to facilitate reading.The axes should be added to Supplementary Figure 2 to help visualize which loci have a consistent direction of effect.In Supplementary Figure 3, “Overll” should read “Overall”.

et al. have undertaken a two-sample MR study using 235 independent SNPs for eBMD in UKbiobank and tested them for T2D and CHD risk in DIAGRAM and CARDIOGRAMplusC4D. They found a small increase in T2D and CHD risk, whose confidence intervals overlapped, or nearly overlapped the null. This is a well-done study, addressing an important problem using modern Mendelian randomization techniques. Major Comments:
The authors have tested 12 traits and two diseases. They have made no attempt to correct for multiple testing. Given that the effects on T2D and CHD have p-values very near to 0.05, should they not make the reader aware that these results may have arisen by chance? I acknowledge that many of the traits are correlated, but given the number of hypothesis tested, it would be quite helpful to discuss the role that multiple testing may have had in their results.A standard deviation change in BMD is a very large change. The resultant changes in risk of T2D and CHD were correspondingly small. In my opinion, it would be helpful to emphasize this to the reader in the abstract, the results and conclusions.It would be helpful to know how population stratification was handled in the GWAS for eBMD.The authors should state that MR-Egger tests for unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy, rather than “pleiotropy”.It is not clear how the genetic associations with the 12 established metabolic risk factors were identified. It appears they were mostly from UKB? If so, they would be biased towards the observational effect.The authors should be applauded for bringing up the clinically relevant point that bisphosphonate use is not at all associated with an increased risk of CHD in studies available to date. Even if they were, the effects of these medications on BMD are far lower than one standard deviation and thus the effects on CHD risk would be anticipated to be even closer to the null than the results presented by the authors.

et al. present a well-written protocol manuscript describing a multi centre, unblinded Phase II pilot RCT of children 2 months to 12 years with severe acute gastroenteritis.  The two arms of the RCT consists of care per WHO Plan C (control) vs. slow rehydration (intervention).  Introduction The rationale and need for the trial is well described.  The authors provide needed background with respect to existing practice and 'WHO plan C' for readers practicing in different clinical contexts.  Local audit data supports the contention that existing dogma and practice protocols should be challenged.  A systematic review has also recently been conducted.Methods The trial methods are described in detail however some questions may remain for readers.  While the rehydration and resuscitative aspects of the intervention and control arm are clear, it is not entirely clear how the issue of maintenance fluids needs and ongoing excess losses are managed.  The authors do note that children are permitted to drink if able, or alternatively receive nasogastric fluid replacement, but it would be helpful those attempting to replicate the work to understand how maintenance fluid needs and replacement fluids (if applicable) for ongoing stool losses are being handled.  Is the approach protocolized within the trial or pragmatic? As noted by the authors, pilot trials are used to inform planning and for protocol refinement for a full-scale trial.  They are also used to inform feasibility.  The authors have selected reasonable study objectives considering that their protocol is challenging current practice.  On review of the statistical analysis plan (Supplementary File 3), the plan confirms that the primary outcome for the study is the frequency of predefined, fluid related, significant adverse events including; mortality, cardiovascular collapse, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary oedema and allergic reaction.  This outcome will be analyzed as follows: The proportion of children with a pre-specified significant adverse event at 48hours in the Plan C and the GASTRO slow arm will be compared using an unadjusted chi-squared test on 1 degree of freedom Risk difference (95% CI) and risk ratio (95% CI) will also be presented.  What is interesting to note is that pilot trials are usually not powered to detect statistical significance (which the authors need not apologize for) and so it is unclear what the 'pass' threshold is for the authors in terms of numeric differences in adverse events between the control (WHO Plan C) and intervention arm.  The danger in employing statistical tests on the frequency of safety events in a small trial is that a) this provides false reassurance when real safety concerns may exist, or b) the authors are left in the uncomfortable position of finding a statistically significant difference in the setting of a small sample size (which may occur due to random chance) and which may threaten the ability to proceed with an otherwise worthwhile and important trial.  What is the authors pass threshold for moving on to the next stage?Ethics Consent procedures are described in detail and this group has prior experience with deferred consent.  It is worth noting that failure to approach families of deceased children could result in differential drop-out between the two study arms and that data from these patients will not be included in the analysis.  This has potential implications for their primary (safety) outcome.  Other studies (in different clinical contexts) have approached decision-makers to seek consent following the death of a child and found this practice to be not only straightforward, but also of some potential benefit though such interactions are not intended to be therapeutic.Discussion The authors present a compelling discussion and it is refreshing to see them share some preliminary feasibility information with respect to their both their struggles in implementing the pilot trial and their willingness to implement protocol changes when deemed necessary.  Research in the real world entails unanticipated challenges and the authors should be congratulated for their candor.Supplemental files Useful information for readers is included as supplementary files, which are well organized and straightforward to follow.Additional The manuscript contains some minor spelling and grammatical errors which are easily corrected, should post-publication corrections be allowed.

Although the systematics of the anopheline mosquitoes has resulted in revised taxonomy and nomenclature over the many decades (precision in species identification, expanding groups and complexes, refined phylogenetic relationships, for example), one overriding theme to these assembled works has been a greater understanding of the mosquitoes’ complex role in malaria transmission in specific areas.  Where competent vectors exist (primary or secondary), perennial or seasonal, the specter of transmission risk persists.  The compiled inventory is a prime example of Science as a series of building blocks, with history serving as its foundation (with the occasional evolving paradigm shift).  Never lose sight of the past – it can be invaluable no matter the age.  Historical references provide both a temporal-spatial ‘baseline’ and confirmation of vector presence that can too easily become ‘lost’, thereby denying a larger audience of invaluable data on specific locations that might not be revisited for a long time to come.  Moreover, this article serves as a template to emulate in other malaria endemic regions of the world – for those so daring.  This publication provides a solid foundation from which to continue to add ‘points’ to the African map as older information continues to surface and new data is gathered.  Despite the monumental effort to assemble and display vector distributions, the authors acknowledge there remain documents yet to recover.

However, following are two issues to address:
It appears that important sources of information have been national inventories developed by entomologists working in Africa, which sounds very interesting. Furthermore, the use of historical archive and unpublished material has been fundamental in expanding the understanding of the spatial ranges of primary and secondary malaria vectors. However, the authors have not provided a detailed description of data sources to highlight the contribution of unpublished material in the inventory of anopheles that is being published.

P. cynomolgi genome. They performed short-read Illumina and long-read PacBio sequencing of DNA isolated from the PcyM strain. Assembly of these sequences yielded a markedly improved reference genome with substantially less gaps and much better coverage of the subtelomeric regions. Furthermore, manual curtation resulted in substantially improved gene models and better annotation of gene functions. Comparative genome analysis highlighted interesting dynamics in copy number variation of specific gene families (MSP, STP1, PIR), and in particular a peculiar expansion of methyltransferase pseudogenes. This manuscript is well written and describe a well-executed assembly and annotation of the
P. cynomolgi reference genome. This reference genome will be well appreciated in the field and will likely fuel further exploration of genome evolution, vaccine candidates and hypnozoite biology alike. “Major” comments:
It would be important to clarify what is the relevance for the use of the
P vivax reference genome during the assembly. I.e. are there contigs which are purely linked based on their assumed synteny to
P. vivax. If so how many such “connections” are present? Also a more detailed description of the manual annotation would be appreciated. I.e. what sort of changes has been made and based on what kind of evidences?I think it would be important to clarify if the PcyB and M strains are indeed represent one and the same (in which case the PcyB/M name would be appropriate) or two closely related isolates. If it can be concluded with high confidence this information should be mention in the abstract as well.The potential function and origin of the methyltransferase could perhaps be better analyzed and discussed. After a quick domain search I realized that this methyltransferases also contain multiple ankyrin domains. More importantly homology search suggests that this is/was a nicotinamide N-methyltransferase and hence might also play a role in nicotinamide metabolism. Intriguingly some methyltransferases (e.g. SET8, Kishore, BMC Evol Bio, 2013
1) and some members of the nicotinamide pathway (O’Hara, PLOS One, 2014
2) in Plasmodia might be resulted from horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, it could be interesting to investigate if this could be the case for this particular gene as well. Minor points:
Supplementary table 1 is not very useful in its current form. It is rather cumbersome to select out the genes which are only present in certain species. Perhaps the authors could sort the table according to the clusters presented on figure 2.It is nice that the same color scheme is used throughout the manuscript, but the color of Pcy, Pc and Pk are rather similar and difficult to tell apart. In particular on Figure 4 this is problematic.Perhaps it would be more logic to discuss the improved subtelomeres earlier in the manuscript (i.e before the OrthoMCL clustering)Figure 3 B and C could be better labelled.The improved reference genome should be made available in GeneDB and PlasmoDB as well.Finally, the authors mention that genes specific to hypnozoite forming parasites mainly belong to variant multigene families and unlikely to be relevant for hypnozoite formation. Perhaps it would be worthwhile identifying genes which are not unique, but substantially different in these parasites (indels, unexpectedly high number of SNPs, etc).

Presumably, the cytokine responses were too low so total concentration would not be valuable for interpretation. The paper would benefit from consistent use of the % shift above baseline data.Figure 2 does switch between total concentration of cytokine (panels A and B) and % change from baseline (panels C – I). We opted to use the % change from baseline in most cases as the levels of cytokine varied between the participants and for clarity we decided to standardize the starting levels to baseline. In general the concentrations of cytokines were above the levels of detection of the assays.  IL-12p70 is one example where they were not. Four out of the five controls had no detectable IL-12p70 at any point in the study, therefore we decided to present the data as total concentration rather than change from baseline
. IL-10 levels were at the limit of detection of the MSD V-plex assay but we were confident  presenting them as % change from baseline as comparable concentrations of cytokine were detected when we tested the majority of samples in a high sensitivity S-plex MSD assay. Unfortunately we did not test the IL-10 levels of the norovirus infected individual as we had no remaining serum or plasma aliquots and therefore the data were not presented in this manuscript.We presented the changes in IL-2 levels in concentration of cytokine again for reasons of clarity. Injection of Proleukin increases the levels of IL-2 in the plasma approaching 400,000 % above baseline. The secondary peak in IL-2 levels were 100,000 % above baseline in the norovirus infected individual. We can present the IL-2 data as a percentage change from baseline if required and have created an updated figure accordingly. Please

The manuscript would benefit from a discussion on how these autoimmune cell types may have contributed to the witnessed phenotypes. That is, did the combination of autoimmune disorder, infection, and IL-2 administration augmented the witnessed phenotypes?This is a very interesting question and one that is very hard to address without healthy individuals with or without norovirus infection and much larger sample sizes. We have added additional text to the discussion to highlight this interesting aspect of the work.  “Despite the limitation of our study to individuals with type 1 diabetes participating in a clinical trial, detailed insights into the biology of Tregs in infection were achieved. Tregs are a key immune cell subset critical to maintaining immune tolerance, and have been considered to be defective in type 1 diabetes [37].  The increase in Treg frequency following norovirus infection was consistent with observations from studies in non-diabetic individuals with acute and chronic viral infections, malaria, and bacterial or fungal sepsis [38-44]. However in the absence of healthy controls and additional T1D patients with or without norovirus infection we cannot determine whether the regulatory or effector responses to infection are optimal in our diabetic participants. Modelling disease outcomes in mice has highlighted the complex inter-relationship between effector function and immune regulation by Tregs in response to infection. Rather than suppressing immune responses, Tregs were shown to coordinate immunity at the mucosal site of infection [45] and facilitate the generation of memory CD8
+ T cells [46,47] in acute viral infections models.  The disease course was of normal duration in the affected participant and we propose that Proleukin administration was not detrimental to the response to norovirus in our trial participant”.",11,7,2017,2017-7-11,PMC5531165,Research Article,28815218,NA,Capturing the systemic immune signature of a norovirus infection: an n-of-1 case study within a clinical trial.,2017-07-18,research-article; journal article;

Emerging models of dynamic brain physiology address this need but barriers remain in model implementation for broad dissemination and collaboration in research community. WeBCMD addresses these barriers and has the potential to accelerate scientific advancement in the field. WeBCMD in its current form is already a functional and useful research tool.

The problems associated with missing or inconsistent equations and/or parameter values will be well known to every researcher who has attempted to implement a mathematical model from the literature. However, without such models being fully reproducible, it is difficult to use them in any meaningful way. There have been some steps in the direction of model repositories, for example the CellML database (https://www.cellml.org/), which is based on the XML markup language. Despite this, these repositories do require users to download and to learn to use particular software, which can be at different levels of development and require a considerable effort to run. For the dedicated user, such an effort can well be worthwhile; it does, however, make the barrier to entry into the field quite high. The approach adopted in this article is thus to try to remove as many of these barriers as possible, which is a thoroughly welcome step. The models that have been implemented have been developed over the last 10-15 years and are now well-established in the field of cerebral blood flow and metabolism. They can be used with confidence, and the equations and parameter values are presented clearly both here and in the literature. I used the model directly through the webpage (I did not try the alternative approach of downloading it and running it from inside the Docker container). For a first release it is wisely kept deliberately simple and the model parameters are clearly presented with default values. It was extremely easy to use and the simulations were completed very quickly with the very useful feature of being able to download the results in .csv format. It is helpful to have the Lotka-Volterra example so that users can try a very simple model first if desired. This is thus an enormously positive and helpful piece of work, smoothing the path to entry very considerably. Any user can run the model directly from the webpage. The only barrier to entry is now being able to understand the physiological model being implemented. It will be extremely helpful in exploiting these models and it would be hoped that in the future other models will be added to develop a 'one-stop shop' for such models. There are a few minor typos that could usefully be ironed out and I am sure that the authors plan to add a few more features in future (top of my request list would be the addition of units for all the parameter values!); however, I applaud the authors for what they have achieved already and look forward to its future development.I have read this submission.

Ectopic expression of proteins is an important tool, for example for complementation studies. Random integration of expression constructs is most frequently used, but suffers from variability largely due to the influence of local chromatin environment. There has also been some debate about the best heterologous promoters to use in DT40. This methods paper explores the use of three promoters in expression constructs knocked into two distinct loci, one heterochromatic and one euchromatic. The results are pretty clear: the CAG promoter gives the highest levels of expression but, interestingly, performs equally well in the repressive environment of the ovalbumin locus as in the euchromatin near
TOPBP1. This is a very useful study and should help improve consistency in complementation studies in DT40 by showing that the
OVA locus can be used similarly to
ROSA26 in mice. I have only a few minor suggestions to improve the presentation of the results: 
It would be helpful to define the acronyms used for the promoters at the start, preferably in the abstract.The labelling of Figure 1B – G could be improved to make it clear on the Western blots those clones that are expressing from a correctly integrated construct and those that are from random integrants. Use of numbering would help link the Westerns and Southerns. Incidentally, the red boxes in Figure 1 are not mentioned in the legend. Indeed, it might be worth pointing out that the SIOS constructs will still work if not correctly integrated, and that some assessment of correct targeting is needed alongside testing for expression.Some of the font sizes on the Figures need attention e.g. the graph in Figure 2G.‘experimental’ is redundant in the last sentence of the abstract.

OVA locus or at an adjacent region in DT40 cells. Effectively, this reads as a limited set of optimisation experiments for a standardised integration site for transgene expression. A more completely cross-factored analysis could be useful but the limited choice of parameters explored here makes it difficult to be convinced even that the CAG promoter is the most efficient for expression at OVA-integrated transgenes in DT40.
Reproducibility is not demonstrated convincingly. Quantitation from the immunoblots in Fig 1B and 1C seems to be based on a single experiment, with a markedly limited sample size (2-4 clones, obtained in individual rounds of targeting and examined once, from what is described in the MS.). This is not convincing in terms of general applicability. The fluctuations in CBA2 and CBA4 expression levels between Fig 1C and 1G indicate the need for repeated analyses and larger number of samples. Similar issues apply to Figure 2.The use of tagged TopBP1 as a readout of promoter efficacy in TopBP1(+/+/-) cells is problematic. This is not a reporter gene but one whose expression levels influence cell status. Even though the transgene expression level does not vary much once established, as in Fig. 3 A, these clones have already been clonally selected, possibly for their expression level. This is a difficulty in generalising the findings presented here to other transgenes of interest.  A similar set of experiments with reporter genes would obviate this potential concern.Stability of transgene expression is another issue of great importance in designing SIOS experiments. Some quantitative idea of how well the relative expression levels are retained would be valuable. This is indicated in Figure 3A but for individual clones of each promoter type targeted within the OVA locus, rather than for the entire dataset.  Is this stability clone-dependent or promoter-dependent (i.e., do low-level CAG clones show lower stability than high-level?).  Minor commentsDetails of how the 30 kb chicken TopBP1 locus was removed would be useful.Figure panels should be cited in order in the text or positioned appropriately.  Figure 2G is not described in the text.Figure quality should be improved. Variable font sizes and formats, poor labelling of marker positions in immunoblots and unjustified use of 3d bar graphs detract from the overall impression of the manuscript. Furthermore, the immunoblots presented are not of the highest quality; for example, it would be difficult to normalise the FLAG signal with the alpha-tubulin signals shown in Figs. 1B, 1F, 2C, 3A.It is not clear which of the various lines shown in Figs. 1 and/ or 2 are used in Fig. 3D.The Discussion could include mention of the promoter analyses performed in Yang et al.

et al 
1 using an isolate of
Plasmodium falciparum more recently derived from patient material.  Microvesicles, or extracellular vesicles (EV) have previously been shown to activate immune cells and trigger gametocytogenesis, and a deeper understanding of the proteins displayed by them could support further hypotheses about their role
in vivo.  The data presented here increases the list of proteins identified and suggests that EV are derived from internal vesicular structures rather than the infected erythrocyte membrane.  Comments:
The term “clinically relevant” in the abstract is not supported by any clinical data about the infection the parasite line 9605 was derived from.  Additionally, after 70 cycles of
in vitro culture, while this isolate is closer to its patient origins than 3D7 it is not known how closely it still represents the original sample.  This is acknowledged by the authors later in the paper and will require further work to define the changes that occur during culturing.  For example, it may be possible that parasites reduce the release of EV or alter the spectrum of proteins released, but no data are provided to support this other than the single 9605 line.What was the rationale to use “fractionated” in-gel digestion for (membrane-rich) EVs? Did the authors try alternative protocols that facilitate the identification of membrane-bound proteins such as FASP (filter-aided sample preparation)?What was the proportion of “contaminants” (false hits) that were excluded from the analysis?The potential role of EV in malaria infections is an exciting field but the data supporting their direct effect on endothelial activation, independent of cytoadherence, are limited.  Of the references cited (#7, 10-12) two are from mouse studies, one does not identify whether EV were involved in the
in vitro model system used and one shows EV activation of monocytes and neutrophils but not endothelium. The finding of 57 out of 61 parasite proteins from the RT sample being in the TR sample might show some reproducibility but could also be considered surprising given the temporal regulation of expression seen in the erythrocytic cycle of
P. falciparum.   Does this suggest that proteins exported to the erythrocytic cytoplasm and vesicles within this compartment are retained for the whole cycle despite relatively stringent control of mRNA production? Could the lack of discovery of PfEMP1 peptides be related to their absence from the 9605 genome sequence available for proteomic analysis?  How well did the subtelomeric regions assemble for this isolate?  The pool of this protein within the cell is thought to be significant and it has been associated with the Maurer’s Clefts, so its lack is interesting. Some comment on the dominance of ribosomal proteins in the list of hits specifically identified in this study, compared to Mantel et al, would be useful.  Is this a technical issue?  How might this be interpreted in terms of the origin of EV?The presence of virulence proteins in exosomes appears to be one of the major findings in this manuscript. Perhaps, the authors should detail the criteria used to include proteins under “virulence-associated parasite proteins”.The point being made in the final paragraph of the discussion is not entirely clear.  The display of internal parasite antigens by EV could explain exposure of these to the immune system, but this is also covered by the rupture of infected erythrocytes.  What is the specific role of EV in this context?  Some clarification would be useful.  Along similar lines, what is meant in the conclusions about “fine-tuning the host immune response, preparing the host cell for invasion and acquiring nutrients from the environment”.  Which parts of the dataset contribute to these suggestions? In the supplementary material, it would be useful to have a column with the common names of proteins in Table S1, as shown in Table S2 under “product description”. Have any of the proteins identified in the proteomic analysis been validated using an independent method, like Western blot or enzyme immunoassays?  Perhaps the major limitation of the study is that the proteomic description of EVs is limited to a single isolate and a single “experiment” / culture. It would have been desirable to see a similar analysis for few clinical isolates or, at least, in more than one culture from the same isolate, although this is partially mitigated through the comparison with previously published data.  This would have been helpful to appreciate the experimental and biological variability. It is not uncommon for proteomics (or any –
omics) studies to generate a number of interesting hits (proteins of interest) followed by hypotheses or plausible explanations about the biological phenomenon under study. The risks associated with this approach (sharpshooter fallacy) can be partially circumvented by proposing hypotheses that can be tested experimentally or by validating the mass spectrometry findings using alternative methods.  What would be the single most important experiment or that would follow logically from the description provided in the manuscript?We have read this submission.

et al. describes proteomic analysis of
P. falciparum-derived extracellular vesicles from a clinical isolate. The presented data expand our knowledge of the protein content of these vesicles and provide a basis for diagnostic and functional studies. The manuscript is well written, however the data analysis and presentation is lacking some detail that would be helpful for interpretation. Most importantly the authors conclude they have analyzed exosomes originating from apical organelles rather than EVs derived from the IE surface. This may be true, see also comments below, but then the title and description of data should be altered. Some specific comments below:  
There is no systematic comparison between RT and TR proteome. It is assumed that the TR-specific proteome is enriched in egress material but that remains to be confirmed (see below).The TR sample includes egress and invasion events. Therefore materials released during this phase will be present in the sample. An egress proteome has been published
1 and should be included in the comparative analysis.Note that recently another EV proteome was published that should also be included in this analysis
2.In the comparison with the proteome data from Mantel
et al the majority of additional proteins is ribosomal (Figure 3c). These are unlikely vesicle-derived but rather contaminants. Is there an explanation for this? The conclusion that the Kenyan strain contains a larger variety of EV proteins in comparison to 3D7/CS2 cannot be drawn as different populations of EVs (with this study including egress vesicles) were analysed.PHIST and Rifin proteins are detected in EVs but it is concluded EVs are not derived from the IE surface. This would be surprising since the previous analysis also included RBC proteins and detected a number of surface antigens including glycophorins. Was host proteome also investigated here?It is mentioned that many merozoite antigens are detected, mostly from rhoptries but also micronemes. This would again suggest egress vesicles  (or what the authors call exosomes) rather than vesicles released during between invasion and egress.The authors conclude that they may have analyzed exosomes rather than EVs, and that exosomes may form from apical organelles. The argument that EVs can only be exosomes is not conclusive. The authors argue that EVs cannot be derived from the erythrocyte despite identifying components of the erythrocyte membrane in their proteome (e.g. band 3, top right paragraph on page 5). Selective cargo loading of
P. falciparum proteins might occur at the erythrocyte membrane and thus explain why only some RBC membrane localized parasite proteins are detected in EVs.The authors conclude that EVs may derive from Maurer’s clefts as several Maurer’s clefts proteins were identified. In combination with their conclusion that PfEVs are only comprised of exosomes, do the authors suggest that Maurer’s clefts are multivesicular body like compartments? Are there any reports about vesicles inside Maurer’s clefts?

Their comprehensive assessment covered the properties and caveats of the W-test, the key results of simulation and real data analysis in the original paper, as well as additional comparisons of W-test against a set of existing methods. The assessment led them to conclude that W-test had virtually no advantages over the existing methods in explicitly testing pairwise epistatic interactions, but could be a useful alternative in GWAS for detection of low frequency or rare variants. I like to thank the authors for their efforts because detection of epistasis or statistical gene-gene interaction has been challenging for a long time, and is longing for not only innovative but also robust methods and examples (Zietz H.,
Am J Hum Genet 100: 379-84, 2017). The study is well designed, well executed and technically sound. The paper is well written and easy to follow. I hope the comments below are helpful to improve the paper:
Slightly surprisingly, neither the current nor the original W-test paper cited the recent review of detecting epistasis in human complex traits (Wei
et al.,
Nat Rev Genet 15: 722-33, 2014), where methods for testing interactions, rather than the whole pair effects, have been discussed. Issues of LD, marginal/main effects and capturing rare or low frequency variants have also been discussed in the review. Addition of the review in citation would make the discussion more interesting.It seems important to make clear that testing epistasis is to test interaction terms, not the overall effects of the whole pair. From that perspective, it might help to slightly reshape the presentation of the power results, e.g. high power in W-test when no interactions simulated to be interpreted as a disadvantage/problem instead? Nonetheless, it is good to point out that W-test can be a useful filter to select candidate pairs for explicit interaction tests, at a price of missing true interactions without important main effects.It seems also important to make clear that two markers in high LD carry little epistasis, although the pair could be statistically significant by haplotype effects. The property that a pair of closely located markers may capture rare haplotypes in the form of significant statistical epistasis has been explored for identifying rare variants and/or functional regulatory mechanisms (Wei
et al.
PLoS One 8: e71203, 2013;
Hum Mol Genet 23: 5061-8, 2014). W-test seems to have advantages in this aspect, particularly in situations of multiple markers.

The authors especially compared the method to the logistic regression with 8 degrees of freedom. The simulation studies showed that the W-test has good/conservative type I error rates and better power than the Chi-squared test and Logistic regression under certain scenarios. Howey and Cordell pointed out a data quality control problem in the original paper, and raised concerned about the reported real bio-markers. The paper concluded that the W-test was a useful and practical method in real GWAS data analysis, especially for low frequency and rare variants.  The specific comments are as follows.
The authors raised an interesting point about the theoretical properties of the W-test. They argued that the Wang
et al estimates the distribution of a pair of SNPs based on bootstrapping many other pairs, therefore pulling information from the entire data set. They suggestion that one could rather bootstrap only using a single pair to achieve a more accurate distribution. However, single-pair-based estimation would require that bootstrapping to be separately conducted for every pair under consideration, versus the current approach of Wang
 et al. that uses a pooled distribution from many pairs, such the B=200~400 bootstrapping is performed once for all. Single-pair based bootstrap falls in-between permutation tests and current approach. While Wang
 et al’s approach is more suitable for exhaustive pairwise evaluation in GWAS, the single-pair bootstrap is more suitable for candidate set study. A combination of the two methods could be realized in a stage-wise selection, the pooled distribution can be first used to screen the entire data set, followed by single pair bootstrap performed only for the top or significant interactions.In the simulation study of the paper (Figure 5), the authors simulated a data with high LD and low frequency SNPs. When applying the W-test, the parameters h and f that determine the test distribution are borrowed from an external data with a different genetic architecture, rather than bootstrapping the working data. This would render the power of the W-test. One important advantage of the W-test is that the its distribution parameters are estimated using the working data to correct the bias of p-values due to complex data structures. Though in the current outcome (Figure 5), W-test still performed slightly better than LR8 and CHI-r, its performance should be even better if the distribution’s parameters are actually bootstrapped using the working data.  The same point also applies to other simulation results in Figure 3, 4, though the problem is less serious there as the simulation data are less complex.We thank the authors to report the SNPs with genotyping errors and to share the list of exclusion SNPs. The real data analysis part by the W-test was re-done by us and posted on the following website:
http://www2.ccrb.cuhk.edu.hk/wtest/materials/W-test%20-%20revised%204%20Aug%202017.pdf . This highlights the importance of data quality control, that inappropriate raw data processing would greatly affect the final result, and the importance of validation.The Q-Q plot presented in Wang
 et al. aimed to show that the W-test’s estimated probability distribution under null hypothesis matches the data set’s distribution, therefore showing the reliability of the W-test p-values. The Q-Q plot was not intended to show the observed p-value distribution. The fact that the Q-Q plot was generated using “permutated phenotypes” was stated clearly in the original manuscript. However, the point of Howey and Cordell is well taken that QQ-plot is usually performed using observed data. The wtest R package has updated (in CRAN, and in
http://www2.ccrb.cuhk.edu.hk/wtest/download.html ) to incorporate this option – user can choose to draw a QQ plot using either permutated phenotype or observed phenotype, according to different purposes.

tbx21 in cells expressing NK1.1, resulting in loss of T-bet expression in a subset of immune cells. In the current climate of developing our understanding of mechanisms using conditional KO mice, basic data on how models work has clear value to the immunological community and data indicating the success of problems with this type of model can really benefit other researchers. It is also important for researchers to fully assess how well different conditional KO mouse models work with robust controls – it is now apparent that one cannot simply assume either specific or efficient cre-mediated deletion simply because of the intentioned design of the mouse model. Within the data presented here, it is striking that tissue specific effects are observed, particularly given the interest in tissue residency of ILC populations and the potential for tissue-specific differentiation. Much of the data is clearly presented and appears robust in terms of the analysis of NK/ILC1 populations. There are some modest concerns with manuscript as it stands - some in terms of presentation of the data and some in terms of the experimental setup and methodology. Experimental design:
The control mice used here are ‘floxed only’ controls rather than ‘cre only’ controls. The latter is better as it enables the impact of expression of the bacteriophage protein (cre), which is clearly a ‘foreign’ element expressed in the mouse. A number of studies have demonstrated that cre expression can impact on aspects of the immune system (e.g. Lck in T cell development in the thymus). This should be acknowledged within the description of the data.The authors should have fate-mapped cre expression in their mice in their hands to enable the efficiency of cre-expression to be properly addressed. This would clarify the extent to which NK1.1 expressing cells show evidence of cre mediated deletion, informing the understanding of NK1.1+ cells that retain T-bet expression. Whilst beyond the scope of this study now, it again could be noted.
 Methodology:
The SI LP prep is clearly sub-optimal for ILC populations – the fraction of the Lineage negative cells expressing IL-7Rα is substantially less than seen with other methods and there is clearly a substantial range in terms of numbers of cells isolated. Thus the data from the SI LP prep is of limited value given the spread of data and the obvious issues in cell isolation. Thus this data appears very preliminary and suboptimal - this should be recognised in the description of this data.
 Presentation of data:
In Figures B,D, E, G and H it would be more appropriate to show the median rather than the mean (which is what I assume the bar represents – it is not described in the figure legend). One cannot assume the data is normally distributed and plotting the median would eliminate bias driven by clear outliers - for example the data in Figure H, absolute number clearly suffers from this, as does the similar data in ‘G’. The data in all these graphs should show median, not mean and this should be articulated in the Figure Legend.It is not clear to me in the SI LP analysis (in part ‘F’) why Lin-IL-7Ra+ cells are not gated on – there is a clear IL-7Ra+ population, but the gate includes IL-7Ra- cells. Given that the aim of this analysis is to look at ILC populations (but with no reference to conventional NK cells which are IL-7Ra-), a more specific gate would seem sensible – this would be my recommendation.Also in part F, the plots of T-bet expression would benefit from an indication of where the authors consider +ve and –ve T-bet staining. This would seem reasonably uncontentious given the populations observed.

Further, we identify NK cells as Lin- NK1.1+, rather than Lin- NKp46+, to avoid potential confounding effects of reduced NKp46 expression.” The authors should have fate-mapped cre expression in their mice in their hands to enable the efficiency of cre-expression to be properly addressed. This would clarify the extent to which NK1.1 expressing cells show evidence of cre mediated deletion, informing the understanding of NK1.1+ cells that retain T-bet expression. Whilst beyond the scope of this study now, it again could be noted.Although we have not done this ourselves, fate mapping of the Ncr1
iCre mice was done as part of the characterisation when they were first developed. We have added this to the Discussion of version 2:   “We were surprised to note that Tbx21 excision seemed to be less efficient in liver ILC1 than cNK, because fate mapping of iCre activity under the Ncr1 promoter using R26R
eYFP has previously shown that iCre activity is higher in ILC1 than cNK
9.” The SI LP prep is clearly sub-optimal for ILC populations – the fraction of the Lineage negative cells expressing IL-7Rα is substantially less than seen with other methods and there is clearly a substantial range in terms of numbers of cells isolated. Thus the data from the SI LP prep is of limited value given the spread of data and the obvious issues in cell isolation. Thus this data appears very preliminary and suboptimal - this should be recognised in the description of this data.We acknowledge this in version 2. In the Discussion:   “We were able to isolate fewer Lin- CD127+ ILC from the small intestine than has previously been reported, but even with this sub-optimal cell isolation procedure we made findings similar to that of Rankin
et al., observing a ~6-fold reduction in ILC1 (defined here as Lin- CD127+ RORγt+ NKp46-) and a ~24-fold reduction in NKp46+ ILC3 (defined here as Lin- CD127+ RORγt+ NKp46+) compared to littermate controls (
Figures 1F–H).” In Figures B,D, E, G and H it would be more appropriate to show the median rather than the mean (which is what I assume the bar represents – it is not described in the figure legend). One cannot assume the data is normally distributed and plotting the median would eliminate bias driven by clear outliers - for example the data in Figure H, absolute number clearly suffers from this, as does the similar data in ‘G’. The data in all these graphs should show median, not mean and this should be articulated in the Figure Legend.We have done this in version 2. It is not clear to me in the SI LP analysis (in part ‘F’) why Lin-IL-7Ra+ cells are not gated on – there is a clear IL-7Ra+ population, but the gate includes IL-7Ra- cells. Given that the aim of this analysis is to look at ILC populations (but with no reference to conventional NK cells which are IL-7Ra-), a more specific gate would seem sensible – this would be my recommendation.Because our aim in the siLP analysis was to confirm the findings from Rankin et al, we used their gating strategy: ILC1 and NKp46+ ILC3 as a proportion of total lineage negative cells. However, we do agree that gating on Lin- CD127+ cells is more appropriate for identifying ILCs and we have reanalysed the data using this strategy in version 2. Readers who wish to compare our data directly to that of Rankin et al may refer to version 1, which will still be available.",3,7,2017,2017-7-3,PMC5543419,Research Note,28815219,NA,Conventional NK cells and ILC1 are partially ablated in the livers of Ncr1 iCreTbx21 fl/fl mice.,2017-07-05,research-article; journal article;

Previous works suggested the presence of at least two routes for RNA substrates to be recruited to the exosome complex’s exonuclease activity site in the Rrp44/Dis3 protein. The Rrp44 protein also has a weak endonuclease activity site in its N-terminal region. The activity of exosome is also regulated by a few co-factor proteins. These all lend the complex a rather complicated RNA degradation or processing mechanism that still awaits to be fully revealed. The authors in this work used CRAC technology in combination with the RNase protection to analyze the RNA substrates that are loaded to Rrp44 protein and protected by the exosome complex. Their results showed the accumulation of 10-nt RNA species bound to Rrp44’s C-terminal region and the absence of 30-nt RNA species. Instead, they observed a broad shallow peak around 20-nt. Interestingly, the lack of endonuclease activity caused the reduction of the 10-nt RNA species. Deep sequencing analysis of the bound RNAs showed a whole spectrum of RNA species bound to Rrp44, indicating a complex behavior of the exosome in RNA substrate recruitment in vivo. The authors proposed the presence of another pathway for RNA substrates to be recruited to the exosome and a potential role played by the endonuclease during the different pathways. This work provided new data to study the exosome-RNA transactions although the exact mechanism seemed more complicated than proposed previously or in this work. More data would be helpful if the authors can also perform similar CRAC of yeast strains lacking Rrp6 gene to understand the cytoplasmic exosome’s substrate more clearly. A minor issue is that the author didn’t explain what the Rrp44-exo-S1 mutant is.I have read this submission.

in vivo with the wild type exosome or with mutants that are defective for the exo- or endonucleolytic function.  They exploit the RNase protection step included in the CRAC protocol and assess the average length of protected fragments to infer the topology of RNA degradation by the exosome . Using a standard protocol for sequencing (50nt reads) they see a distribution of length with a clear peak at very short reads (6-8 in the wt and 9-10 in the exo- mutant). Formation of these short fragments requires the endonucleolytic function of the exosome. The authors propose that these fragments derive from endonucleolytic cleavage of stalled substrates in the central channel of the exosome. Using a longer read sequencing protocol, they observed the presence of two additional peaks (39 and 44nt) that likely represent fragments derived from substrates that are being degraded after threading through the central channel. Mapping of these read classes allowed inferring on the substrate preferences for the mechanisms of degradation (i.e. direct path or threading through the central core). This is a well-conducted study that provides many interesting details on the mechanism of RNA degradation by the exosome. The data convincingly support the model proposed. What follow are a few suggestions that could complement the study.  
The distribution of the mismatches due to crosslinking is not exploited in the study. This could provide useful information on the nature of the reads. For instance, the authors propose that the 39 and 44nt reads derive from protection either by the sole central channel, or by the central channel and the helicases associated (Mtr4 or Ski2). If this is true, the two families of reads should have an identical distribution of crosslinking sites when aligned to the 3’ end. Also, reads derived from threading or direct access should have a different distribution of mismatches.The authors propose that stalled substrates threaded through the central core are cleaved by the endo activity for further processing. This should imply endo cleavage of substrates within the central core. Is this consistent with current structural models ? The authors should comment on this.Use of a mutant that prevents threading might allow demonstrating that the 39nt and 44nt reads indeed derive from substrates being threaded through the central core

This is an interesting issue since the exosome has two main nucleolytic activities and their relative importance and how different RNAs access these different sites is not clear. Based on
in vitro experiments, one would predict that the exosome would protect RNAs of ~30 bases when they are threaded through the barrel of the exosome, and ~10 bases when the RNA accesses the active site directly. The main contribution of this work is to use deep sequencing to identify fragments of RNA protected by the exosome
in vivo.  The approach is to cross link RNA to the exosome
in vivo, purify the exosome and then the cross-linked RNAs are digested to protected fragments subjected to deep sequencing.  This work revealed the WT exosome protects a broad range of RNA sizes with three main classes: 1) an enrichment ~6-8 bases, which is dependent on the endo activity, and converts to ~10 bases in the absence of exo activity: 2) a broad size distribution from 12-34 that is largely independent of exo or endo nuclease activities, and 3) RNAs of 39 and 44, which are not dependent on the direct entry channel and are likely to reflect RNAs that are threaded through the exosome barrel, but more than 30 bases are protected possibly due to exosome co-factors. Taken together, this provides insight that the endonuclease activity may be quite important for releasing RNAs that are stalled during exonucleolytic degradation.  It also highlights that understanding the size of RNAs protected by the exosome
 in vivo will suggest unanswered questions about how RNA molecules interact with the exosome and access the active sites. The experiments are well done and the interpretations valid.  Some suggestions that could be considered to improve the work are given below:    
Although not required for indexing, it would be interesting to know if the reads that map to mRNAs (Figure 2C&D) map to distinct subsets of mRNAs. For example, the exosome would be predicted to preferentially target mRNAs with slow decapping rates, which might be revealed by a more granular analysis of the read distribution to different mRNAs.I might rephrase the summary of the work to highlight that there is a clear set of fragments of 39 & 44 bases, which would be consistent with RNAs threaded through the barrel of the exosome but protected by additional co-factors.  As written now, one is not aware of these fragments till deeper in the manuscript and the comments about co-factors in the conclusions come a bit out of the blue.Although not required for indexing, it would be interesting to see how the shorter reads are affected by the exo-S1 mutations.

et al. uses sophisticated phenotypic assays to dissect the role of MIC2 in the
Toxoplasma gondii life cycle. Although the experiments are well executed and the conclusions are largely sound, the authors mainly recapitulate the discoveries of previous studies (Huynh & Carruthers. 2006; Harker
et al. 2014). The current study differs in its use of a previously published direct knockout of MIC2 (Andenmatten et al. 2013), which clearly dispels many of the caveats of conditional knockout systems and demonstrates that MIC2 is not strictly essential for
T. gondii. It is worth noting that the 2006 study concluded that MIC2 was a major determinant of invasion and virulence, but did not conclude that the gene was essential, consistent with the results presented by Gras
et al.
 The new study identifies defects in attachment, gliding motility and invasion. It extends some of these observations further, by noting that the speed of motility and invasion are not altered, despite the shorter and less frequent tracks of movement and lower rates of invasion. Even under the simplistic models of gliding motility, a reduction in adhesins could have been predicted to reduce parasite attachment, which consequently would have reduced the strength, stability and persistence of movement. However, this study provides carefully crafted experiments to demonstrate these principles. By dividing egress between vacuole permeabilization and disruption the authors identify a delay in egress that may have been missed in the published analysis of the conditional knockout. Similarly, the authors clearly document lower levels of growth without MIC2 in the animal model, although mortality remains unchanged. At face value, these results differ from the previous report. However it was known that the background used for the conditional knockout what attenuated, and what supported the involvement of MIC2 in virulence in the Huynh and Carruthers study, was the sensitivity of the conditional knockout but not the parental strain to ATC (the agent used to downregulated MIC2 expression). The current study also showed diminished replication of MIC2 knockout in mice, however in their case this defect did not alter the ultimate virulence of the strain. While these discrepancies may reflect differences between the two studies, no mechanistic explanation is provided to account for the discordant results. In the absence of direct comparisons between the complete and conditional knockouts, such differences might represent variability in how the experiments are performed or in the basal virulence of the parasites used (as noted by the authors). Taken together, the current study provides a robust confirmation for the functions of MIC2 using the latest and most rigorous methods available in the field. Major concerns:

1. The current study largely corroborates the earlier findings, and includes additional analyses that more thoroughly establish a role for MIC2 in initiating gliding motility in both 2D and 3D gliding assays. Importantly, the study also includes assessment of transcriptional changes in MIC2 knockout parasites. Overall, data in the current study is of high quality, well controlled, and the phenotypic assessments are thorough and robust for most experiments. The conclusions are also generally well supported by the data, and the article is well written and accessible to a wide audience. Addressing the following aspects will further improve the study.  
The most striking apparent difference between the conditional knockdown and the knockout is seen in infected mice. Infection studies with the conditional knockdown required injection of a relatively high inoculum of 50,000 tachyzoites to overcome the intrinsic virulence deficiency of the Tet regulated (Tati) strain, a fact that is discussed in the current study as the potential basis for the apparent discrepancy in assessment of virulence. 50,000 Tati parasites is the minimum dose needed to consistently observe lethal infection. Attaining lethal infection in 33% of mice infected with MIC2 conditional knockdown parasites required injection of 3x107 tachyzoites, which is 625 times higher than for the Tati strain. The current study uses a non-Tati strain that is presumably equally virulent to the RH strain, although this was not evaluated. RH strain has an effective LD100 of 1 viable tachyzoite via IP injection. However, assessment of virulence in this study was conducted by injecting 1,000 tachyzoites, which is 1000x the LD100. Most studies assess the virulence of mutants in an RH strain background by injecting 10-100 tachyzoites, and several more recent studies have utilized subcutaneous injection because this route renders it easier to detect a virulence deficiency. Accordingly, the conclusion that MIC2 knockout parasites have a minor virulence defect is not substantiated by the data as it currently stands without a more thorough assessment with lower inocula. In the absence of such an assessment, because a 1000x LD100 dose was used in the current study it theoretically remains possible that MIC2 knockout parasites have a loss of virulence that is similar or equal to that of MIC2 knockdown parasites. The authors should either address this aspect with additional experiments, or acknowledge this possibility in the discussion. Also, it appears that the virulence experiment was only performed once, and with only 5 mice per group. Thus, reproducibility was not established, and the experiment is underpowered.The authors conclude that MIC2 knockout parasites have a similar distribution in infected mice as WT parasites. There are two limitations to this conclusion. First, the resolution of whole body bioluminescence is very poor, and thus does not allow one to distinguish between organs unless the organs are removed and imaged individually. Second, IP infection with RH strain parasites results mostly in intraperitoneal replication, with limited dissemination prior to mortality. The authors should assess bioluminescence in individual organs or acknowledge  limitations of using this approach and the strain in assessing dissemination.The caption for Figure 4 states: “Maximal speed of gliding is not impacted by mic2 KO”. This is somewhat misleading because it describes the findings of only 20% of the data in the figure. The figure has 10 panels or graphs, 8 of which show differences in gliding between WT and mic2 KO parasites. The figure caption should describe both the differences and the similarities.Please provide y-axis labels for the middle and right panels of Fig S3. Also, for the sentence: “Surprisingly, the average and maximum speeds increased compared to WT parasites (Figure S3)” it should be explicitly indicated that this is for circular gliding.Please describe in the materials and methods how the virulence experiment shown in Fig 7A was performed, including stating the number of times the experiment was performed and the number of animals in the experiment. Also, indicate in the legend of Fig 7 the inoculum for the bioluminescence experiment, and state in the methods the number of times the experiment was performed along with the number of mice used.Examples shown in Fig 6D do not match the categories used for quantification in Fig. 6C. The authors should consider showing an example of an intact PV instead of the “Lysed” example. Also, it would be ideal to explicitly state in the materials and methods that for assessing egress the fixed monolayers were not detergent permeabilized.

See our detailed response below (in bold):The most striking apparent difference between the conditional knockdown and the knockout is seen in infected mice. Infection studies with the conditional knockdown required injection of a relatively high inoculum of 50,000 tachyzoites to overcome the intrinsic virulence deficiency of the Tet regulated (Tati) strain, a fact that is discussed in the current study as the potential basis for the apparent discrepancy in assessment of virulence. 50,000 Tati parasites is the minimum dose needed to consistently observe lethal infection. Attaining lethal infection in 33% of mice infected with MIC2 conditional knockdown parasites required injection of 3x107 tachyzoites, which is 625 times higher than for the Tati strain. The current study uses a non-Tati strain that is presumably equally virulent to the RH strain, although this was not evaluated. RH strain has an effective LD100 of 1 viable tachyzoite via IP injection. However, assessment of virulence in this study was conducted by injecting 1,000 tachyzoites, which is 1000x the LD100. Most studies assess the virulence of mutants in an RH strain background by injecting 10-100 tachyzoites, and several more recent studies have utilized subcutaneous injection because this route renders it easier to detect a virulence deficiency. Accordingly, the conclusion that MIC2 knockout parasites have a minor virulence defect is not substantiated by the data as it currently stands without a more thorough assessment with lower inocula. In the absence of such an assessment, because a 1000x LD100 dose was used in the current study it theoretically remains possible that MIC2 knockout parasites have a loss of virulence that is similar or equal to that of MIC2 knockdown parasites. The authors should either address this aspect with additional experiments, or acknowledge this possibility in the discussion. Also, it appears that the virulence experiment was only performed once, and with only 5 mice per group. Thus, reproducibility was not established, and the experiment is underpowered.The authors conclude that MIC2 knockout parasites have a similar distribution in infected mice as WT parasites. There are two limitations to this conclusion. First, the resolution of whole body bioluminescence is very poor, and thus does not allow one to distinguish between organs unless the organs are removed and imaged individually. Second, IP infection with RH strain parasites results mostly in intraperitoneal replication, with limited dissemination prior to mortality. The authors should assess bioluminescence in individual organs or acknowledge limitations of using this approach and the strain in assessing dissemination.We agree with the reviewer that the results need to be interpreted with care and changed our discussion according to the reviewers suggestions. It reads now:“Most surprisingly, and in contrast to the results obtained for the MIC2 conditional knockdown ( Huynh & Carruthers, 2006), we find that mic2 KO parasites are only mildly attenuated compared to WT RH parasites. The mic2 KO line (at least at the doses used in these studies) induces lethal disease in BALB/c mice.The mic2 KO line induces lethal disease in BALB/c mice, and transfection of these parasites with a luciferase gene demonstrated that they grow in similar anatomical locations in mice as control parasites. One explanation for the different findings could be that RH TATi ΔHX, the parasite line used to generate a knockdown for mic2 is already severely attenuated due to the expression of the Tet-transactivator. Indeed, in the study by Huynh & Carruthers, 2006, high doses (5 × 10 4 tachyzoites) with RH TATi ΔHX were required to achieve normal time-to-death kinetics. It is thus possible that knockdown of mic2 in this strain reflects an enhancement of the already attenuated phenotype, while depletion in a WT background has only mild effects on parasite virulence. Alternatively, in our studies a reduced virulence of mic2KO parasites is not evident because of the relatively high numbers of tachyzoites used to facilitate in vivo imaging. Consequently to fully compare the virulence LD50 studies would be required. Nonetheless our studies demonstrate unequivocally that MIC2 is not necessary for in vivo infection and lethality in BALB/c mice. In vivo imaging and 3D diffuse tomographic reconstruction of mice infected with MIC2 deficient parasites transfected with a luciferase gene demonstrated that they grow in similar anatomical locations in mice as control parasites. However, dissection and histopathological analyses would be necessary to rule out any potential differences in tissue trophism.""The caption for Figure 4 states: “Maximal speed of gliding is not impacted by mic2 KO”. This is somewhat misleading because it describes the findings of only 20% of the data in the figure. The figure has 10 panels or graphs, 8 of which show differences in gliding between WT and mic2 KO parasites. The figure caption should describe both the differences and the similarities.The capitation now read “Figure 4: Gliding initiation and gliding distance are affected by
mic2 KO attachment defect but not maximal speed”Please provide y-axis labels for the middle and right panels of Fig S3. Also, for the sentence: “Surprisingly, the average and maximum speeds increased compared to WT parasites (Figure S3)” it should be explicitly indicated that this is for circular gliding.Modification have been made and the text now reads “Surprisingly, the average and maximum speeds of circular gliding increased compared to WT parasites (Figure S3).”Please describe in the materials and methods how the virulence experiment shown in Fig 7A was performed, including stating the number of times the experiment was performed and the number of animals in the experiment. Also, indicate in the legend of Fig 7 the inoculum for the bioluminescence experiment, and state in the methods the number of times the experiment was performed along with the number of mice used.We updated the Material Methods section and describe the virulence experiments in greater detail.Examples shown in Fig 6D do not match the categories used for quantification in Fig. 6C. The authors should consider showing an example of an intact PV instead of the “Lysed” example. Also, it would be ideal to explicitly state in the materials and methods that for assessing egress the fixed monolayers were not detergent permeabilized.We changed Figure 6D as suggested and updated Material and Methods as suggested.",10,7,2017,2017-7-10,PMC5473411,Research Article,28630943,NA,"Parasites lacking the micronemal protein MIC2 are deficient in surface attachment and host cell egress, but remain virulent in vivo.",2017-05-19,research-article; journal article;

1, only a few naturally occurring transmissible cancers have so far been identified in dogs, soft-shell clams and in Tasmanian devils. The lack of evidence for transmissible cancers can be related to several factors: (i) although neoplasia has been recorded in most metazoans, wildlife cancer statistics are, however, highly scattered in the scientific literature and hence challenging to access
2, (ii) lack of systematic screening (using large datasets) for the presence of clonally transmitted malignant cells in wildlife, (iii) failure to recognize extinct contagious cancers (that have been eliminated due to their detrimental impact on host fitness during the eons of evolution). Similar to pathogens/parasites, neoplasia (particularly communicable ones) can have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild and therefore be an important, but so far overlooked, evolutionary force that should not be ignored.  The study by Ní Leathlobhair
et al. is one of the first, hopefully many more to come, systematic studies that attempts to identify the etiology of a wildlife cancer with high prevalence. The authors should be recommended for publishing negative results in search of wildlife transmissible cancers. In general, the paper would have benefited from higher sample sizes and the inclusion of more molecular markers into the analyses, although most likely the outcome of the paper, refuting the transmission hypothesis, would not have changed. One general concern with the article is basing the analysis solely on a fragment of mtDNA without acknowledging the potential hazard of amplifying nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs). NUMTs are insertions of mitochondrial DNA sequences into the nuclear genome, becoming pseudogenes, which are thought to be the remnants of gene transfer from mitochondria to nucleus
3. The transposition of mtDNA sequences into the nuclear genome has been documented in a wide variety of taxa, from fungi to insects to vertebrates
4. Although mounting evidence is suggesting that the occurrence of NUMTs is a ubiquitous phenomenon
5 studies frequently overlook their potential presence and generate unreliable results. NUMTs can be amplified in PCR reactions alongside their mitochondrial counterparts, becoming a source of contamination in mtDNA analysis
6. This is an issue that is often overlooked in studies of mtDNA and can result in misguided conclusions.  Although the outcome of the study by Ní Leathlobhair
et al. would not have changed by the presence of NUMts, it would be so nice to see the scientific community finally acknowledging that simply amplifying fragments of mtDNA is not an acceptable scientific method to conduct evolutionary, population genetics, phylogenetic etc. studies.  There are several practices to screen for the presence of NUMTs, e.g. serial dilution method
7, nested approach to the PCR reactions
8, isolation of the mitochondrial genome during DNA extraction
9, digestion of nuclear DNA with DNase
10, sequencing of the entire mitochondria genome, for example through next generation sequencing (but see Verscheure, et al., 2015
11, also Calvignac, S. et al. 2011
12, Hazkani-Covo, E. et al. 2010
13). In summary, the study by Ní Leathlobhair
et al. is a nice contribution to the transmissible cancer literature, a delight to read, but I would highly encourage the authors of any future population genetic, phylogenetic and evolutionary studies to refrain from only analysing fragments of mtDNA, failing to amplify pure mtDNA can lead to unreliable results and erroneous conclusions. I would really like the practice of mtDNA fragment analysis (without eliminating NUMTs) to disappear from future scientific works.I have read this submission.

et al. conducted a straightforward test of the hypothesis that sea lions urogenital carcinoma (UGC) could be a transmissible cancer. They sequenced the mtDNA control region of seven tumors and their respective host tissue. They observed four different haplotypes in their sample and in each of the seven comparisons the two sequences were identical. This was the case even after a close inspection of the chromatograms to verify the presence of a possibly under-amplified sequence. Leathlobhair
et al. study therefore does not support the hypothesis that sea lions UGC is a clonally transmitted cancer. Transmissible cancer is thought a rare exception. However, this conclusion suffers from a lack of a rigorous appreciation of the effort invested to test for genetic differences between tumor and host cells. In the wildlife especially, it is difficult to know how often the hypothesis of transmissible cancer is tested. For this reason the publication of negative results is essential and needs to be promoted. Although sea lions UGC was a pertinent suspect with an infectious aetiology suspected for years and a possible route of transmission via sexual relationship as in CTVT, the hypothesis of clonal transmission has not been tested/published before the timely study of Leathlobhair
et al.
 The paper is clearly written and addresses all the relevant issues. I would suggest the authors to take the opportunity of their publication to promote a more systematic examination of the hypothesis of cancer transmission, possibly with an associated database. One question raised by Leathlobhair
et al. study is about the genotyping effort required to definitively reject direct infection by cancer cells. Here the authors analyzed only 7 pairs with only one mtDNA marker with low nucleotide diversity. They rightly discussed the issue of mitochondrial captures, already reported in CTVT, which would be required to explain their data under the transmission hypothesis. However, only three captures is required to generate the four haplotypes observed in tumors. What makes the transmission hypothesis unlikely is the perfect match observed for rare haplotypes in CSL 6 and CSL 7. Nonetheless the authors could have provided a better idea of the nucleotide diversity observed in a wider sample of sea lions by using published data (eg in Gonzalez-Suarez
et al. 2009 Mol Ecol, Schramm
et al. 2009 Mar Biol). In addition, horizontal transfer has been found rare in the two mammalian transmissible cancers found to date, but this can be different for another new one. Riquet
et al (2017) found 5 chimeric mussels thought to be infected by transmissible neoplasia with a combination of a nuclear SNP array and mtDNA sequences, but only two had the mtDNA of the transmissible lineage initially found in the pacific mussels by Metzger
et al. (2016). The other three individuals had a perfect match with their host with mtDNA sequences while being chimeric at many nuclear SNPs. With only those three mussels and the use of mtDNA sequences, they would have missed the hypothesis of transmissible cancer in their sample. I would therefore suggest the authors to encourage the use of more markers, even if I am convinced that this first screen mostly refutes the transmission hypothesis. Genotyping a handful of nuclear markers is easy nowadays and I would not like subsequent studies to content to use only mtDNA sequences. Finally, one can suspect not so unlikely that standard oncogenic transformation of host tissue can sometimes infect a new host with few success of subsequent propagation -e.g. killing the new host rapidly because already at the metastatic stage. We would have a combination of standard and transmissible cancer lineages that would need a more extensive examination. To conclude, I very much enjoyed this paper, the approach is straightforward, I think a test of genetic chimerism in such a serious candidate as sea lions UGC was more than timely, I mostly concur that the hypothesis of clonal transmission can be rejected, and I thank the authors to promote by this submission a systematic search of transmissible cancer in the wildlife and the publication of “negative” results.I have read this submission.

et al. paper is an interesting article investigating the etiology of a cancer with high prevalence in California sea lions, specifically testing the hypothesis that it could be due to a transmissible cancer. Findings of transmissible cancer in multiple species has raised the possibility that other cancers could be due to transmission of cancer cells, specifically those that occur at high prevalence and those that have a plausible route of transmission, as are the case with the sea lion urogenital carcinomas. The finding of mtDNA SNPs between individuals, but no evidence of a neoplasia-associated allele strongly suggests that this disease is not a transmissible cancer. Since this result relies on the lack of detection of additional alleles on the chromatograms at polymorphic sites, it would be good to see at least a few examples of images from the chromatograms. However, given the analysis of paired host/tumor samples, this should have been obvious if present, unless the tumor cells only represent a small fraction of the tumor sample. Nuclear loci could have been checked to confirm this finding, but, as stated in the paper, in order to have transmissible cancer with no differences in the mtDNA it would require an unprecedented amount of mitochondrial transfer. Minor issue: It is unclear what primers were used for the PCR. The methods says that a 1289 bp fragment was amplified, but the reference cited appears to use two primer pairs to amplify mtDNA, generating 625 and 500 bp products. This reference (Wolf
et al.) includes a table of other primers, but doesn't appear to list the primers for these PCR reactions, but the Features sections in the GenBank submissions reported in the paper does. Since neither of the primer pairs reported in the Wolf
et al. study match the size reported, it is unclear if these are the primers used, however. It should be simple to add the sequences of the primers used to clarify the methods, as there was only one PCR done in this study. Overall, the results were negative, but it is important and valuable to other researchers to publish them, as it is a plausible hypothesis to explain the etiology of this common cancer.I have read this submission.

Easier unit tests and better examples with exampletestr and covr describes the `exampletestr` package that parses the example code in the manual pages and converts it into unit test stubs to be then completed by the developer. I read the manuscript and found it was clearly written. I also successfully executed the examples in the package vignette. In general, I believe the authors have prepared a useful package and have described it well. I have however two important points I would like to raise. My first point is that I think it would be useful for the authors to provide a better rational for unit testing. In my opinion, the current version of the text is obvious to those that already know about and practice unit testing. However, the goal of this work is to appeal to the many that haven't adopted unit testing in their standard development yet. For those, it might be useful to provide more background and to emphasise the important of unit testing. My second point is that by focusing on code from examples, some of the most important unit tests are systematically missed out. Indeed, one generally documents a typical, default,
best case application of the code/package in the documentation files. One could argue that the goal of unit testing is to go beyond these, and assess the execution of the edge cases. Using some material from my
own work, some example would be - to test the validity of empty data/objects (where users wouldn't, generally, produce empty data instances, and this wouldn't be described in the manual page); - verify that an example object that is distributed with the package (and loaded with `load`), that was created from a distributed example files (for instance in `inst/extdata/`), remained valid and identical throughout the evolution of the classes and constructors; - other examples illustrate how unit tests can be build and refined against a set of functions specifications, i.e. expected outputs. Similarly, code presented in examples illustrate exported and high level code, while unit tests might rather want to address specific and private functions, that in turn are called within the high level user space functions. Another important point is that writing (or thinking about) unit tests often influences how one writes code, testable code, which is not reflected in writing code in the manual examples. Also, although efficiency (in terms of time when checking the package) is not a concern, at least in a first instance, a side effect of basing unit test on examples, results in re-running the same code twice. For unit testing, it might be worth wile to extend code coverage to rarely used lines of code by tuning arguments accordingly. In the vignette, the author clearly states that ""The Goal is NOT Fully Automated Unit Test Creation"". May be this could also be mentioned in the manuscript. A minor suggestion would be to drop `covr` from the title, as it might mislead readers that the manuscript also addresses directly that package. Also, I was wondering what happened if an example code chunk was not run (wrapped in `\dontrun`). Is it ignores by `exampletestr`? To conclude, I think the manuscript would benefit greatly from a better introduction/discussion for newcomers. The second issue I have relates to the scope or validity of basing unit test on examples. While I do not expect `exampletestr` (or any other package) to come up with valid general unit tests generation recipe, I think it would be essential to recast and discuss unit testing into a broader scope.I have read this submission.

This is a good point. exampletestr is made for packages in which the author did not write tests as the package was being developed.

This is unfortunate, however I think having a set of unit tests which affirm that your examples are working properly very useful and worth having in spite of this re-running (which is, as you eluded to, not a big concern most of the time).For unit testing, it might be worth wile to extend code coverage to rarely used lines of code by tuning arguments accordingly.

This database is unique in that in collects information about
Plasmodium falciparum genetic modifications in one place and enables users to search the database using both systematic gene IDs and text search. Overall I believe this paper describes a very useful resource and will help scientists more easily access data about various types of mutants in
Plasmodium.  I have a number of minor suggestions and comments that should make this resource even more useful:  
In this sentence “Nevertheless, rodent parasites do not contain orthologs of every
P. falciparum gene, so these studies alone cannot provide a complete view of the parasite genetics
underlying causing human disease.”, The words underlying causing right after each other don’t make sense. I think one of these words should be dropped.Community contribution section – it would be useful to highlight the success of the community user comment system that has been in place at EuPathDB databases for over 10 years.  Thousands of crowd-sourced user comments on genes have been entered and many of these have been used to guide curation teams to improve and edit annotation.  This would serve as a nice example of how crowd sourcing works even with scientists!“Genes are linked to previous aliases by an “Aliases” table, and to each other by orthology by the “Orthology” table, which contains links where both OrthoMCL group and synteny is conserved.” This sentence sounds a bit awkward – authors should think about rephrasing.Once a search is run, a table of disrupted genes is reported.  It would be useful if the number of rows (or genes) in the table is reported at the top of the page. Results table: it would be nice if the header of the table is sticky (or locked) so when a user scrolls down they can still see the column names. I found myself having to keep scrolling up and down.Once you run a search there the table contains various symbols eg. Check marks and exclamation marks. These also differ in color intensity/opacity. It wasn’t clear to me what these mean and I could not find a description of what they mean on the site. Maybe I missed it? Regardless it would be good if those can be provided on mouse over or on the site of the table as a legend. Perhaps taking the figure legend from figure 1 in the paper and making available to all table results on the database.How robust was the google scholar search to identify gene id aliases? Both GeneDB and PlasmoDB keep a list of aliases as well. Did you use these? What about genbank or UniProt accession numbers, have those been included as aliases?In the results section the number or genes reported with information in PhenoPlasm differs slightly than what it on the website. I am assuming this is due to ongoing curation which is great! It would be good to state something like “At the time of manuscript preparation…”“For posterity, the complete data has been additionally deposited on Figshare (
https://doi. org/10.6084/m9. gshare.5114017), and will be regularly updated.” Can you define what regularly updated means? Once a month, once a year? How will this be done? Is there a mechanism in place to do this? How important is this anyway?Data presented in Figure 4 is cute but not sure how much it adds to the paper. I am not against it, I just don’t think it adds anything useful.Literature review using google scholar: I think it is important to provide a full list of terms used as a supplemental table.

Was it only based on google scholar or did it also involved reading of papers.

I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.",3,7,2017,2017-7-3,PMC5500895,Data Note,28748223,NA,PhenoPlasm: a database of disruption phenotypes for malaria parasite genes.,2017-06-21,data-paper; journal article; 
NA,NA,Sanderson,Theo,NA,"Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK",NA,"We are very grateful for this rapid review and the helpful suggestions you have made. We have responded inline below for clarity.This is a nice paper describing the PhenoPlasm database. This database is unique in that in collects information about Plasmodium falciparum genetic modifications in one place and enables users to search the database using both systematic gene IDs and text search. Overall I believe this paper describes a very useful resource and will help scientists more easily access data about various types of mutants in Plasmodium.  I have a number of minor suggestions and comments that should make this resource even more useful:In this sentence “Nevertheless, rodent parasites do not contain orthologs of every P. falciparum gene, so these studies alone cannot provide a complete view of the parasite genetics underlying causing human disease.”, The words underlying causing right after each other don’t make sense. I think one of these words should be dropped.Thank you. This has been fixed.Community contribution section – it would be useful to highlight the success of the community user comment system that has been in place at EuPathDB databases for over 10 years.  Thousands of crowd-sourced user comments on genes have been entered and many of these have been used to guide curation teams to improve and edit annotation.  This would serve as a nice example of how crowd sourcing works even with scientists!This is a great point that we have put into the text. We are very keen on allowing community contribution, which is the reason we provide the facility, and it is great to have an example to draw on of how this can work in practice.“Genes are linked to previous aliases by an “Aliases” table, and to each other by orthology by the “Orthology” table, which contains links where both OrthoMCL group and synteny is conserved.” This sentence sounds a bit awkward – authors should think about rephrasing.We have now done so.Once a search is run, a table of disrupted genes is reported.  It would be useful if the number of rows (or genes) in the table is reported at the top of the page. Thank you for this suggestion. This has been added and indeed improves the interface.Results table: it would be nice if the header of the table is sticky (or locked) so when a user scrolls down they can still see the column names. I found myself having to keep scrolling up and down.This is a helpful point that we do accept. It currently poses technical challenges. As an intermediate solution we have added mouseover tooltip text to the icons which indicates which stage they correspond to as well as what the icon represents. We hope to make the column headers stick at a future date.Once you run a search there the table contains various symbols eg. Check marks and exclamation marks. These also differ in color intensity/opacity. It wasn’t clear to me what these mean and I could not find a description of what they mean on the site. Maybe I missed it? Regardless it would be good if those can be provided on mouse over or on the site of the table as a legend. Perhaps taking the figure legend from figure 1 in the paper and making available to all table results on the database.This is a great point raised by both reviewers which we have now implemented. There is a page listing these on the site but this was somewhat buried.How robust was the google scholar search to identify gene id aliases? Both GeneDB and PlasmoDB keep a list of aliases as well. Did you use these? What about genbank or UniProt accession numbers, have those been included as aliases?We have clarified this section. The feature uses the PlasmoDB previous IDs (which are now acknowledged in the text) and provides a simple mechanism to conduct a search for “PF3D7_123456 OR MAL13P.123456 OR ….” to identify references to the gene. GenBank and UniProt accession numbers have not been included at this time. We believe relatively few knock-out studies use such identifiers.In the results section the number or genes reported with information in PhenoPlasm differs slightly than what it on the website. I am assuming this is due to ongoing curation which is great! It would be good to state something like “At the time of manuscript preparation…”Your explanation is exactly correct, and we have implemented this suggestion. Thank you.“For posterity, the complete data has been additionally deposited on Figshare (
https://doi. org/10.6084/m9. gshare.5114017), and will be regularly updated.” Can you define what regularly updated means? Once a month, once a year? How will this be done? Is there a mechanism in place to do this? How important is this anyway?We were aware that a common concern upon the creation of databases is that should funding run out the database will become defunct and inaccessible, and this was our attempt to defuse such concerns by ensuring the data would be available in perpetuity regardless. We have clarified that this will take place at least yearly. We do not feel that this a major concern for 
our database, but then we suspect that the creators of now-defunct databases did not either, so this seems a sensible insurance policy. This process is currently manual.Data presented in Figure 4 is cute but not sure how much it adds to the paper. I am not against it, I just don’t think it adds anything useful.We think this history is (somewhat) interesting, and are keen to make it publically available. We had no clear idea what this graph would like until we plotted it, because systematised data is needed to do so. We do accept it is a very minor application of the database which will only be useful if (for instance) cited in a review paper.Literature review using google scholar: I think it is important to provide a full list of terms used as a supplemental table. Also, it might even be better to provide a link to the advanced google scholar search so readers can try them out for themselves.As in response to the other reviewers, we do accept these critiques. Unfortunately, we do not have systematic records of all terms used. As we discuss below, and in response to the other reviewers, further searches yield very few additional genes, giving us confidence that our review has at least been thorough.Manual curation: Needs more description as to how this was conducted. Was it only based on google scholar or did it also involved reading of papers. How many individuals were involved in reading papers and was there any attempt to quality control the results?This curation generally involved reading the papers in question, with rare exceptions where results were very clear from the abstract. All were read by a single person with a handful of exceptions which are the result of community contributions. One way in which results have been quality-controlled (though this was not the primary motivation) has been looking for conflicts between our curated P. falciparum data and PlasmoGEM data (Bushell et al., 2017). These should be enriched for curatorial errors but did not uncover any. Nevertheless there are almost certainly curatorial errors in the database, which we hope will be resolved with the eyes of the community, given that publications are the ultimate source authority.If you refer to attempts to control for the quality of the source data, in general we did not consider this to be necessary.You should be able to extract additional mutant data from user comments in PlasmoDB.  I just did a few quick searches showing that there are some in PlasmoDB not in PhenoPlasm but perhaps this can be a community curation/contribution: 
http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/im.do?s=94dda7211e47d33cThis is a great suggestion, and thank you for providing the search strategy. We have worked through this list and added a number of datapoints. Reassuringly these are mostly cases of insertional mutagenesis or spontaneous deletions, which we did not conduct specifically conduct searches for in putting together the database.",24,7,2017,2017-7-24,PMC5500895,Data Note,28748223,NA,PhenoPlasm: a database of disruption phenotypes for malaria parasite genes.,2017-06-21,data-paper; journal article;

Plasmodium databases RMgmDB and PlasmoGEM and manual curation of phenotype data from publications that have described reverse genetic experiments in
Plasmodium falciparum. This new database will provide an excellent resource for malaria researchers as it will enable them to very rapidly assess whether attempts to disrupt/knockdown a particular gene(s) in any of the various species has already been attempted and if so what the resulting phenotypes are, without having to transform data by orthology. We actually recommend that the database link is included in the abstract. After visiting the database, we noticed there was some additional and very useful features that are not described in the manuscript and we recommend that they are included. For example, the subcellular localisation data and the maps. This puts so much more at the fingertips of researchers. It is ambiguous as to what ‘maps’ refer to until you click on the link so we do recommend that this is called something else, such as ‘pathways protein mapped to’. We also recommend that when a search is undertaken that a key of the symbols is visible on the same page for greater clarity. This is clear in the manuscript but not at all evident when using the database. Figure 1: For CDPK, there is a circled pale green tick indicating the knockout has a wildtype phenotype. However, next to this is an exclamation mark, meaning the phenotype is different from wildtype. Isn’t the circled green tick and exclamation mark mutually exclusive? Figure 2: The word ‘conditional’ is embedded in the text. We were wondering if it would be clearer to instead have an additional column where it could be stated what experimental approach has been used (ie. whether the mutant phenotype data is derived from a gene knockout or conditional knockout/knockdown, etc). For an example, if you search Pf3D7_0929400, the disruptability table indicates the gene is refractory to deletion in
P. falciparum but in the mutant phenotypes table, the phenotype is ! Attenuated. This is somewhat confusing as parasites are not attenuated until after knockdown. Some of the terms that were used in the Literature review section are indicated. However, it would be good to know what the numerous additional terms used were – for example, terms like ‘knockout’, ‘knockdown’, ‘depletion’, ‘conditional’ may have picked up additional publications. For example, HSP101 has been knocked out in
P. berghei, hence why the cross is opaque in the search result (although this is not evident without a key on this page) but HSP101 has also been conditionally knocked down in
P. falciparum (Beck
et al, 2014 Nature) but this is missing from the database. Similarly, other conditional knockouts are missing from the database (Ito
et al, eLIFE, 2017). (This is why we ticked 'partly' for sufficient details of methods as it wasn't clear what the terms used for inclusion criteria were.) Interpro signature section. In the first paragraph (results, page 5), should this be specifically the MSP7 C-terminal domain rather than any of the other MSPs C-terminal domain (for example, MSP1)? In Supp. Table 1, the signatures are from various platforms (eg. SMART, EMBL-EBI Pfam, TIGR, etc) and therefore the same domain may be represented more than once. It may be good to note this in the text. Thus, in some cases, the numbers do not match between search engines. (eg. AAA = 7/20 or 17/33). This section also mentions the MFS transporter as 21/24 being viable but in the supplemental table MFS is listed twice with 8/9 (PF07690) and 3/4 (PS50850) being viable. Are we missing something in the way we are searching this Table? Moreover, we also couldn’t see the 6 cysteine domain in Supp Table 1. There were a couple of minor formatting issues:

NA,NA,Sanderson,Theo,NA,"Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK",NA,"Thank you very much for this rapid and highly constructive review which has significantly improved the database.

For example, the subcellular localisation data and the maps. This puts so much more at the fingertips of researchers. It is ambiguous as to what ‘maps’ refer to until you click on the link so we do recommend that this is called something else, such as ‘pathways protein mapped to’. We agree that “Maps” is confusing and have amended accordingly. We have also added a sentence in the text pointing out we include links out to these resources from the Malaria Metabolic Pathways database.We also recommend that when a search is undertaken that a key of the symbols is visible on the same page for greater clarity. This is clear in the manuscript but not at all evident when using the database. This is an excellent point raised by both reviewers which we have now addressed with an online key.Figure 1: For CDPK, there is a circled pale green tick indicating the knockout has a wildtype phenotype. However, next to this is an exclamation mark, meaning the phenotype is different from wildtype. Isn’t the circled green tick and exclamation mark mutually exclusive? This is an important point illustrated by the phenotypes shown for CDPK4. These phenotypes are indeed in contradiction. This is a genuine case of mutually exclusive experimental reports. Our response to such situations is to display both contradictory phenotypes. This should alert the researcher to a controversy. Clicking on the gene in question allows the sources of the two phenotypes to be traced and a judgement made. In this case there are two reports on RMgmDB of “No difference” for growth in the asexual bloodstage. However PlasmoGEM barseq data suggests a subtle 14% decrease in growth rate. It is possible that a relatively small attenuation like this might be missed with other methodologies, so this is a relatively minor contradiction. The database will also contain less reconcilable differences. At this stage our aim is to present the interested scientist with all reported phenotypes and allow them to draw their own conclusions.  Figure 2: The word ‘conditional’ is embedded in the text. We were wondering if it would be clearer to instead have an additional column where it could be stated what experimental approach has been used (ie. whether the mutant phenotype data is derived from a gene knockout or conditional knockout/knockdown, etc). For an example, if you search Pf3D7_0929400, the disruptability table indicates the gene is refractory to deletion in P. falciparum but in the mutant phenotypes table, the phenotype is ! Attenuated. This is somewhat confusing as parasites are not attenuated until after knockdown. We do understand this concern. In light of this suggestion we tested implementing the suggestion of a column, but ultimately decided it was slightly more confusing simply because of the increased busyness of each phenotype. We will keep this suggestion in mind for the future as we receive more feedback.Some of the terms that were used in the Literature review section are indicated. However, it would be good to know what the numerous additional terms used were – for example, terms like ‘knockout’, ‘knockdown’, ‘depletion’, ‘conditional’ may have picked up additional publications. For example, HSP101 has been knocked out in P. berghei, hence why the cross is opaque in the search result (although this is not evident without a key on this page) but HSP101 has also been conditionally knocked down in P. falciparum (Beck et al, 2014 Nature) but this is missing from the database. Similarly, other conditional knockouts are missing from the database (Ito et al, eLIFE, 2017). (This is why we ticked 'partly' for sufficient details of methods as it wasn't clear what the terms used for inclusion criteria were.) Thank you for pointing out these omissions of specific studies, which we have now rectified. Many of these further search terms were in fact used, but we accept this critique as it would have been useful to have kept an exhaustive list of queries used.  We feel we are now beyond the point of diminishing returns where additional searches have yielded very few new results. For instance the ‘
depletion’ search did not recover any new results in the first 10 pages. There are no doubt further missing phenotypes but we feel these will be best added by engaging with the community.Interpro signature section. In the first paragraph (results, page 5), should this be specifically the MSP7 C-terminal domain rather than any of the other MSPs C-terminal domain (for example, MSP1)? Thank you, we have changed this. We were accurately quoting the InterPro family name but we agree that more specificity is helpful in the text here.In Supp. Table 1, the signatures are from various platforms (eg. SMART, EMBL-EBI Pfam, TIGR, etc) and therefore the same domain may be represented more than once. It may be good to note this in the text. Thus, in some cases, the numbers do not match between search engines. (eg. AAA = 7/20 or 17/33). Yes - we had similar concern , we have now associated phenotypes not with the signature itself but with the parental InterPro family and re-run the analysis. This does not significantly impact the results scientifically but we agree that it makes it easier to interpret the data by avoiding duplicated rows and associating better descriptive names.This section also mentions the MFS transporter as 21/24 being viable but in the supplemental table MFS is listed twice with 8/9 (PF07690) and 3/4 (PS50850) being viable. Are we missing something in the way we are searching this Table? Moreover, we also couldn’t see the 6 cysteine domain in Supp Table 1. The data here was correct, but limited annotation made it confusing to interpret. The signature SSF103473 was 21/24 viable, and does correspond to the MFS InterPro family but the SSF103473 family itself does not have a descriptive name. The same applies to 6-cysteine protein family. Now that we are using InterPro families instead all this confusion should be resolved, since the InterPro family name is listed in the table.There were a couple of minor formatting issues:Delete ‘a’ on line 6. Ie. across a the literature.The quotation marks for terms used in the literature searches need correction.In the results section, second paragraph, italicise P. falciparum.

Would this be active or passive?  POINTS THAT CANNOT BE IMPROVEDIt remains to be shown, but is doubtful, that eradication of a nodule will prevent progression of disease in a different site- the nodule is probably not the seed from which the cord of DD grows, but just a localised manifestation of a diffuse tendency.

As a reviewer, I really feel uncomfortable with allowing this presumption to go unchallenged and insist on suitable justification or dilution.The clinical endpoint- treating nodules of DD before they progress, is laudable but unlikely to be cost effective. Perhaps 11% of people develop DD nodules. These nodules in their early stage might cause anxiety but rarely cause symptoms. It is unlikely that any health care system should view such treatment favourably when comparing the health gains with treating other more symptomatic or sinister conditions funding for which already challenges existing resources.The Authors aim in Study 2 to recruit patients with “up to 60 degrees”. This represents a substantial
cord and does not represent a “

I respectfully advise that this inclusion extends beyond the purpose or capability of the study.The EQ5D questionnaire is worthless in DD as it has no sensitivity to change; it is the wrong PROM.

Yet this distinction is essential. Surely the whole purpose of the study is to examine whether one can prevent a nodule from becoming a cord? This point needs to be fully addressed. Response: We appreciate that nodules represent the early stage of disease, with subsequent development of cords. We will only be recruiting patients with distinct nodules and all injections will be administered intra-nodularly. Accurate assessment of development or extension of cords is very difficult and we will be measuring active and passive joint extension in the early disease stage RCT.In the Introduction and Discussion, there seems to me to have been just a little adornment in the quest to depict the need for this study: the portrayed risks of progression and complications of existing treatment, the alleged lack of cost effectiveness of treatment and the suggested need for prolonged hand therapy. The facts in the introduction should therefore be qualified Response: Please see above our amendment regarding potential complications of existing treatments. We will be assessing cost efficacy of adalimumab as part of our study.RCT evidence shows that splintage is not needed after surgery, let alone for 3 to 6 months. Response: A recent Cochrane review ‘did not recommend routine use but that splinting should be considered on an individual basis’. (Rodrigues et al 2015). We agree that the needs of post-operative patients vary, with some patients requiring splintage but not routinely. This now reads: up to 6 monthsThe recurrence rate of 10 to 12% is derived from just one small study and is likely to be inaccurate (due to definition issues). I would suggest the figure is derived from a suitable review article e.g. Kan et al., 2013 1 Response: Kan 2013 does not report recurrence rates of surgery alone. Recurrence rates from radiotherapy, fasciectomy, fasciotomy, collagenase injection and other treatments ranged from 2 to 80%. We quoted the data from a prospective randomised study (van Rijssen 2012), which compared 41 limited fasciectomy patients (125 joints) with 52 PNF patients (167 joints) after 5 years and found recurrence rates of 21% following limited fasciectomy and 85% following PNF. Page 3, column 1: We have amended the text to read: However, recurrence rates are high, at 5 years affecting 85% of patients treated with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy 
7 and 47% of those treated with collagenase 
14 . Published recurrence data for collagenase are now available at 5 years (Peimer et al., 2015) Response: Page 3, column 1: We have now cited comparable 5 year data and included the reference by Peimer et al (2015)The complications for surgery and PNF and CCH are not comparable- the high rate of complications after CCH, although frequent, are transient. This should be emphasised. Response: Page 3, column 1: This has now been amended to read: over 70%, the majority being minor and mostly transientThe Authors may consider mention that eventually, manipulation of genetic pathways rather than biochemical pathways will lead to the solution for this disease Response: Gene therapy for non-life threatening conditions is some way from the clinic and we consider this to be outside the remit of our trial protocol.The tonometry is described as measuring “the hardness of the palmar tissue overlying the nodule” (page 8). Surely it measures the hardness of the nodule itself, not the palmar tissue overlying it. Response: Page 8, column 2: We have amended this to read
“the hardness of the palmar tissue and the underlying nodule”
The inclusion criteria should include a single digit or palmar disease; otherwise the Michigan score will not distinguish disability from one or more cords Response: By limiting recruitment to single digits the population would be very small and difficult to recruit.  We have included disease specific measures and functional measures.Clarify the “range of motion” measurement. Would this be active or passive? Response: Page 8, column 2: This has now been amended to read: Active and passive range of movement. POINTS THAT CANNOT BE IMPROVEDIt remains to be shown, but is doubtful, that eradication of a nodule will prevent progression of disease in a different site- the nodule is probably not the seed from which the cord of DD grows, but just a localised manifestation of a diffuse tendency. By no means all nodules progress to symptomatic cords This point is crucial, yet seems glossed over in the introduction wherein the Authors make a rather enthusiastic pitch to imply that early treatment of nodules will eradicate the chance of the “risks” of other treatments being required. As a reviewer, I really feel uncomfortable with allowing this presumption to go unchallenged and insist on suitable justification or dilution. Response: Whilst we agree that not all nodules progress to form cords with resultant flexion deformities of the digits, our published data show that there is an inverse correlation between the presence of nodules and disease severity (Verjee et al, JHS 2009. 34A: 1785-94).The clinical endpoint- treating nodules of DD before they progress, is laudable but unlikely to be cost effective. Perhaps 11% of people develop DD nodules. These nodules in their early stage might cause anxiety but rarely cause symptoms. It is unlikely that any health care system should view such treatment favourably when comparing the health gains with treating other more symptomatic or sinister conditions funding for which already challenges existing resources. This study includes an economic evaluation to identify whether it is cost effective or not. Response: There is a clear plan to assess the cost efficacy of adalimumab. Please see tertiary objectives for the early disease RCT (Table 4)The Authors aim in Study 2 to recruit patients with “up to 60 degrees”. This represents a substantial cord and does not represent a “nodule” nor “early DD”.  A cord of 60 degrees is likely to be symptomatic. Unless the proposed treatment removes the cord and thus corrects the deformity, entry into the trial of a patient with a combined deformity of 60 degrees will deprive the subject of treatment of a symptomatic condition. I respectfully advise that this inclusion extends beyond the purpose or capability of the study. Response: Whilst we agree that deformity of 60 degrees at a given joint would not be considered early stage disease, we are referring to up to 30 degrees at the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. Page 9, Table 6: We have clarified this section to read: Participants with early DD nodules shown or reported to progress in the previous 6 months, with a flexion deformity of ≤30° at the metacarpophalangeal and/or at the proximal interphalangeal joint, i.e. total flexion deformity of up to 60° for the digit being assessed. Individuals vary as to the level of deformity that they find acceptable and we will only recruit individuals who do not plan to undergo any elective procedure during the 18 month period of the trial. However, if the deformity progresses such that the participant and their treating clinicians decide to proceed with treatment, this will be recorded.The EQ5D questionnaire is worthless in DD as it has no sensitivity to change; it is the wrong PROM. The Authors have also employed the hand-specific Michigan scale which is probably more suitable although I am not quite sure that references 37 and 38 robustly prove that it has been validated specifically for DD. Response: There are currently no data available for the EQ-5D-5L in assessing early DD. We are aware that whilst it may prove not to be sensitive, the EQ-5D-5L is a validated, generalised, health related quality of life questionnaire recommended by NICE as the accepted measure for conducting a cost-utility analysis. The EQ-5D instrument facilitates the generation of a utility score from a person’s health related quality of life.  A utility score refers to the preference that individuals have for any particular set of health outcomes.  The EQ-5D consists of five health state dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression).  There are three levels of health status to choose from: no problems, some problems, major problems.  Each participant will value their present health at the date of questionnaire completion.   Participants will also complete a Visual Analogue Scale which will provide us with a value for the participant’s self-rated health at the time of survey completion. Page 11, column 2 has been amended accordingly. There are no published data relating to validation of the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire MHQ) in early DD. Reference 37 (Johnston et al 2008) showed that there was a strong correlation between in MHQ score and change in DD digital fixed flexion deformity. Reference 38 (Herweijer et al 2007) demonstrated that the MHQ can detect change in patients before and after surgery for DD. The MHQ has been shown to have high internal consistency which should be useful when exploring the natural course of DD, where changes occur slowly over time (Shauver and Chung 2013).Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?YesIs the study design appropriate for the research question?YesAre sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?YesAre the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?YesReferences1.

NA,NA,Ball,Catherine,NA,"Kennedy Institute University of Oxford, UK",NA,"We would like to thank Professor Isam Atroshi and Professor David Warwick for their supportive referee reports and helpful comments about our clinical trial protocol. In accordance with their suggestions, we have made some changes to the protocol text. We have clarified the degree of digital deformity in early Dupuytren’s disease for inclusion in the RIDD clinical trial. We also have now stated recurrence rates at 5 years. The technique for obtaining tonometry measurements is now described in more detail and we have explained how the photographs are used for consistent placement of the gauge. As requested, further details of the end-user survey concerning acceptance of injection therapy is now provided. We have also clarified that progression to surgery is a decision taken independently of the research team. Queries regarding bias and blinding have been addressed.This is a well-written trial protocol. The trials address research questions that are important in the treatment of Dupuytren’s disease (DD).IntroductionThe statement about the proportions of patients treated with surgery etc in the USA needs a reference and time frame because this changes over time. Response: Page 3, Column 1: Reference now provided: Zhao et al. 2016Postoperative hand therapy for 3-6 months sounds very long, usually not for the typical patient. Response: Page 3, Column 1: We agree that the duration of post-operative hand therapy varies, with some patients requiring more prolonged treatment. This now reads: up to 6 monthsTo state that collagenase injection treatment has over 70% “complication rate” without specifying the type of complications is problematic. For people not familiar with collagenase it would sound that the treatment is not safe when in fact it is a very safe treatment because these “complications” are mostly local reactions such as swelling, minor hematomas, pain etc that resolve completely within days. Applying the same definition of complications to surgery would mean that all patients have complications. Response: Page 3, Column 1: We have now amended this to read: over 70%, where the majority are relatively minor and transient, mainly comprising swelling, bruising and pain after collagenase injection.There are no details about how the “acceptability of injection therapy” survey was conducted. Response: Page 3, Column 2: We now have included further details of the survey and the response rate. We have amended the text to read: We conducted an end user survey of 46 patients, 24 with early DD and 22 who had previously undergone surgery. Thirty-three patients (71.7%) responded 62.5% (n=15) and 82% (n=18) respectively from each group.Objectives and Methods:It is not entirely clear what is meant by “control the progression” of early DD. Response: Table 4, page 7: Progression of early disease is manifest as change in nodule hardness, nodule size or an increase in finger flexion deformity.  How do we know that nodule hardness is a measure of disease progression in patients with DD and joint contracture?andAre there data about the reliability and validity of measuring “nodule hardness” and size? Response: We agree that nodule hardness has not been shown to correlate with joint contracture. Relying on progression of finger flexion as a measure of disease progression would have resulted in an unacceptably long follow up period of 3-5 years. We selected nodule hardness as the primary outcome measure in line with the study by Ketchum et al 2000, who assessed the efficacy of local steroid injection into the nodule. However, whilst Ketchum et al relied on subjective assessment of hardness, we will use tonometry to obtain a quantitative measure. We found that tonometry readings were lower in healthy volunteers compared to people with DD – please refer to the section on Sample size calculation, page 7. We also referenced a publication by Thurston (1987) who used tonometry and reported softening of the palm following excision of Dupuytren’s tissue. We will also use ultrasound scan to assess the size of Dupuytren’s nodules but as there are no previous data using this modality for Dupuytren’s disease we have chosen this parameter as a secondary objective. Measurement of surface area of nodules has been shown not to correlate with disease progression Lanting (2016).Ketchum LD, Donahue TK: The injection of nodules of Dupuytren's disease with triamcinolone acetonide.
J Hand Surg Am. 2000;25(6):1157–62. 11119679 10.1053/jhsu.2000.18493It would be helpful if a brief description of measuring nodule hardness is provided considering it is the primary outcome. Response: Page 11, Column 1: This section has been amended to read: Tissue hardness will be measured with a tonometer, ensuring that the gauge is balanced perpendicular to the skin without application of external pressure by the observer. Five readings will be obtained on each occasion. A photograph obtained at base line marking the spot to be measured will be used for all subsequent measurement to ensure consistency of placement of the tonometer. Tonometry has been used to evaluate skin compliance before and after surgery (Thurston 1987) and reported softening of the palm following excision of Dupuytren’s tissue.Are there any data about responsiveness of the EQ-5D-5L in patients with DD? Response: Page 11, Column 2: The EQ-5D-5L has been used to calculate health state utilities (Gu 2013) in individuals with more advanced DD. This has now been added the section Health Utilities in Clinical outcome measures.Early DD RCT:                                  Definition of “Early” DD: 60 degrees of contracture in a finger is usually not considered early DD. It could be argued whether this is treatment or prevention of disease progression. Can the active injection result in partial or complete reduction of the contracture? What does the patient expect from the treatment? Response: Page 9, Table 6: Whilst we agree that deformity of 60 degrees at a given joint would not be considered early stage disease, we are referring to up to 30 degrees at the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints. We have clarified this section to read: Participants with early DD nodules shown or reported to progress in the previous 6 months, with a flexion deformity of ≤30° at the metacarpophalangeal and/or at the proximal interphalangeal joint, i.e. total flexion deformity of up to 60° for the digit being assessed.It is unclear whether the total flexion deformity of up to 60 degrees applies to 1 finger or multiple fingers, for example if a patient had contractures in the small, ring and middle fingers. Response: Page 9, Table 6: This refers to a single digital flexion deformity of the digit that we are assessing as clarified above.Primary outcome: at what time point? Response: Page 8: The primary outcome is measured over time as described in Table 5, with the final measurement being taken at 18 months.How will the hand photos be evaluated and will it be done blinded? Response: In the Tissue response RCT the photographs will be used to evaluate healing and quality of scarring. Page 11, column 1: In the early DD RCT they will not be evaluated but used to ensure consistent placement of the tonometer.Is the injection painful (more painful than injecting saline)? Can this influence blinding? Response: It is not known whether injection of adalimumab into a nodule is more painful than saline although when administered subcutaneously there were no significant differences in the pain scores (Furst  2003). Pain will not influence blinding as each participant will receive the same treatment (adalimumab or placebo) throughout the course of the study.  Furst, D.E., et al., Adalimumab, a fully human anti tumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody, and concomitant standard antirheumatic therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: results of STAR (Safety Trial of Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis). The Journal of Rheumatology, 2003.
30(12): p. 2563-2571.Does the injection cause local reaction like swelling, bruising etc, and if so how long do these changes persist? Can this influence blinding? Response: The participant will be blinded to the treatment received and, as explained above, will receive the same treatment (adalimumab or placebo) throughout. Therefore, the duration of any local adverse effects will not influence participant blinding. All assessments will be performed by a blinded observer before administration of the injection.It is stated that investigators will be able to discontinue participants on the basis of noncompliance such as not attending some visits; it would be important to avoid introducing risk of bias.  Response: Injections will be discontinued if the participant withdraws from the trial or if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including pregnancy, adverse events, significant protocol deviation or non-compliance with study procedures. Compliance will be defined as attending not less than 75% of injection visits, i.e. 3 visits. We will endeavour to continue to follow up the participants with their consent following withdrawal.How will the possible decision to proceed to surgery during the study be done? Response: The participant will follow the normal clinical pathway. This now reads: Progression to treatment will be determined by clinicians who are not part of the trial team. Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?YesIs the study design appropriate for the research question?YesAre sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?YesAre the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?YesCompeting Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.I have read this submission.

The authors used this dataset to evaluate their recently released method DECoN, a CNV detection tool for targeted NGS panel data and provide these data for similar use to other laboratories. We evaluated the usability of this dataset with our recently published method panelcn.MOPS. Our data access was processed quickly without problems. Analysis of all 96 samples with panelcn.MOPS revealed that the dataset is less homogenous than the data used in our study comparing panelcn.MOPS to five different CNV detection tools. Compared to the dataset used in our study, more samples and regions of the ICR96 samples were classified as low-quality and low correlation of read counts between test and control samples was observed in many cases. Additional optimization of panelcn.MOPS to the provided dataset was required, showing that any method needs to be adapted to the data to be analyzed. Overall, the manuscript clearly describes a very useful dataset for the evaluation of CNV detection in targeted NGS data. Minor comments: Although it is mentioned briefly in Materials and Methods, the origin of the two different pools should be described again in the Dataset section.

Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.11222.r19111,Moscoso,Javier,NA,"1Institute History, Centre for Humanities and Social Sciences, Spanish National Research Council, Madrid, Spain",approve-with-reservations,"This is a very interesting and informative paper about the physiological symptoms of envy, as they were described in, mainly, English medical treatises of the early modern period. The paper claims that the modern discourse on envy was always pathological, essentially due to the way in which envy was interpreted and understood within a humoral theory of disease. The paper sees a historical change in the physiological, but also a evaluative, understanding of envy, corresponding with the transition from humoralism to a mechanical conception of disease; a shift that the author associates with the coming about of a new “paradigm” in the 18th century. The paper focuses on the physiological effects that envy has on the envier, but also touches on some other wider issues, like the social consideration of envy as a dangerous social passion that connoted social strife and disorder. To begin with, the paper does not include any kind of geographical restrictions in its methodological assumptions or in its conclusions. Though the bulk of the text is based on English sources or English translations, the author seems to discuss emotional shifts in an ideal territory that could perhaps be identified with Europe, but not necessarily so. This should be clarified, for two important reasons. First of all, the tendency to identify English history with the whole of European, or Global History, does not seem to agree with current historiographical trends, including post-colonial or global history. Though these kinds of restrictions should always be clear, it is even more so when dealing with the history of the emotions, a field in which geographical or linguistic differences may reflect important cultural distinctions, as cultural anthropology but also cultural history has come to show very often. From a cultural point of view, the expression, but also the physiological experience of emotions may vary depending on the cultural forms in which those very emotions, or passions, are discussed, expressed, or repressed. Still more important for the general thesis of the paper, it might well be that the shift from a physiological experience of envy based on humoralism to a more enlightened model, does not simply apply to many other European or American cultural regions. In Spain and Italy, but also in France, discussion on passions was very often based on humoral theory well up to the mid-19
th century. A simple look at early 19
th century French medical thesis on passions will suffice to make us gain a different picture regarding the continuity or discontinuity of humoral theory of passions beyond the Enlightenment . Secondly, the discussion on envy touches on many other passions, including anger or sorrow. In some occasions, the paper seems to imply that “envy” is a kind of entity that could be divided into “its core elements” (p. 6). The connection between envy and melancholy, of which the papers offers plenty of examples, seems to rely on this kind of relation. On the one hand, the melancholic “was physiological inclined to be envious” (p. 7), whereas on the other, the envious was also described with melancholic features “All the diseases that converge on the black bile are part of the language of envy” (p. 9). This association between the physiology of passions and their moral or philosophical characterization remains the most intriguing and exciting part of the paper. The author might consider, however, to drop the mechanical understanding of history, based on “medical paradigms”, and consider instead, the analysis of the signs of envy inscribed in the body or verbalized by the use of the language. This might offer a much better understanding of the connection between envy and similar passions and conditions: melancholy, of course, but also different forms of ambition, including social and economic ambition. From this point of view, the discussion about the fate of envy during the European Enlightenment would take a quite different approach in terms of continuity or discontinuity. By focusing on the history of the physiological signs, independent of their social or conceptual framing, the paper could also introduce new considerations regarding the history of cancer, and some other incurable diseases, described very often in terms of a corrosion of the body caused by sadness, envy, ambition of different kinds, and so on. In brief, this is a very interesting paper based on first class research. It could be indexed with two important modifications. First, the author should clarify its geographical and cultural scope. The general thesis that the paper defends does not simply correspond with evidences from other European sources and languages. Secondly, the historiographical model that informs the text, based on a mechanical substitution of medical paradigms could be informed by a discussion on the transformation of (physiological) signs into (medical or moral) symptoms. The history of physiological signs will also provide some interesting connections with the history of some other conditions, including the experience of cancer in early modern Europe.

The author argues convincingly that this emotion was regarded – both by medics and spiritual writers - as unequivocally pernicious to the body, unlike some other related passions, such as anger. Associated with the dry, cold humour, ‘melancholy’, it hindered the vital process of digestion, and ultimately could kill by depriving the body of vital heat. The article makes a valuable contribution to the growing historiography on ‘embodied emotion’, and the links between mental and physical health in early modern culture. There are, however, a number of ways in which the article could be developed and strengthened, outlined below.Opening section I wondered if the opening could be made slightly more imaginative, perhaps with use of one of the colourful quotations in the section on the language of envy. The personification of envy, as a leathery-eyed, creaky-boned individual is very striking, and might make a nice way in. In the Introduction, it would also be helpful to be told how early modern people defined emotion (or 'passion' to use their terminology), together with envy (and how it differed – if it did – from jealousy); at the moment, envy is defined on p.2, but the definition has been paraphrased - it would be more powerful to have a contemporary quotation here, and for it to be moved up to the first page.Historiographical contribution and engagement The article displays a sound knowledge of the literature of emotion, both of what has been written specifically on envy, and on the broader scholarship of early modern health and the passions. Several additional important monographs, however, could be brought in where relevant, including:

Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England: Ravenous Natures (Basingstoke, 2015): discusses the imagery of cancer in a way that resonates nicely with your analysis of the metaphors of ‘worms’ and ‘cankers’ in descriptions of envy. When thinking about the ‘gap’ in the literature, and how this article advances knowledge, it occurred to me that one thing it does well, is reveal the interrelationships between individual passions (envy and anger, envy and sadness, etc); as far as I know not a huge amount of work has been carried out on this subject, and it is one which I think you could highlight more explicitly.Methodology and structure In the Methods and Sources section, it is useful to hear how the sources have been selected, but I think a bit more needs to be said about the potential limitations of the sources and search methods. What are the pitfalls to using key word searches, and how have you got around them? For instance, were there other words, which have fallen out of use today, that may have been used in place of the word ‘envy’? How far do the chosen primary texts reflect the attitudes of most people in society? Is it ever possible to access the perceptions of poorer people, who left few records? I expect some popular ballads could be found on envy, which may provide some insights, albeit indirect ones. In this section, it would also be useful to be given a little more information about the purposes, authors, and nature of the various primary sources, including the spiritual/philosophical texts which at the moment are not defined. Indeed, whenever a quotation or example is given, it would be worth giving a word or two of biographical information about the author (even if just their dates). Later in the article (p.8), when discussing Lemnius’ treatise, an interesting point is made about how medical texts tend to mention envy less frequently than religious/philosophical texts, owing to the fact that this emotion did not illustrate the point they wanted to make about the heart and spirits; the heterogeneity of texts in the period is also highlighted here. I felt that this observation needed to be moved to the Methods section, as it justifies why you’ve used philosophical/religious texts as well as medical ones. My other comment about the methodology section is that at the moment it is interspersed with quite detailed explanations of medical theory, e.g. the non-naturals. It might be clearer for the reader if this information could be put into a separate introductory section, perhaps headed ‘Background on Emotion and Health’. The passage explaining the concepts of the spirits and natural heat (currently on p.5) could be inserted here too. The rest of the article’s structure seems effective.Argument and scope  I think the argument that the effects of envy were physical as well as symbolic, is convincing, especially in relation to the loss of nutrition and natural heat. What I felt could be clarified slightly is whether the disease-specific metaphors (comparing envy to plague, leprosy, etc) were meant literally. Did envy actually make people more susceptible to contracting these diseases? If so, how did it do this? Perhaps such phrases were meant both metaphorically and literally. Could envy also cause forms of mental illness, like love sickness and mania? Continuing the subject of metaphors, on p.1 it is stated that medical metaphors were also applied to the spiritual impact of envy – this passion was a disease of the soul, a deadly vice, etc; the implication is that the whole idea of ‘spiritual health’ is a metaphor. From a secular viewpoint, I can see why this language seems metaphorical, but I don’t think that early modern people would have viewed it in this way. They believed that human beings consisted of two parts – the body and soul – and both were capable of health and disease. Thus, when the soul was said to be sick of sin (of which envy was one), they did not mean this metaphorically, but literally. I think this could be clarified in the text. When discussing the ‘evil eye’ of envy, there might be scope to bring in the sense of sight. Why was this sense associated with envy? Do different passions connect with different senses? Finally, a comment on the final section on change over time: I was convinced by the argument that envy was no longer regarded as pernicious to everyone in society (i.e. it was only dangerous to those who ‘indulged’ in it etc). However, the statements about the radical transformation in medical theory and practice perhaps over-state the extent of change, and could be softened. Various historians have shown that the basic belief in the humours (or ‘morbid matter’), and the need for rebalancing and purging, persisted into the eighteenth century, despite the ‘discoveries’ of the likes of Harvey and Newton. Although Boerhaave’s new emphasis on the role of motion and stagnation might seem new, it did in fact bear some resemblance to the older humoral idea that disease could be caused by the obstruction or putrefaction of the spirits/humours, and that health depended on a continual flowing. Many of the traditional humoral remedies aimed at unblocking obstructions, and the reason that emotions like cheerfulness were good for health was because they encouraged the lively movement of the spirits about the body (see Cavallo & Storey’s chapter). In order to incorporate some of the above ideas within the word limit, I think there’s potential for a bit of pruning of words, especially in the introductory section.Minor comments Top of p.3: the sentence ‘potent image of body-related imagery’ – use of ‘image’ twice in one sentence. Could one of them be removed?p.3 ‘concept of study relates to the concept of sin’-  do you mean ‘concept under study’?p.3. the word ‘surge’ is used twice in 2 sentence close together.p.3 missing comma after Fay Bound Alberti.p.3. ‘late seventeenth’ needs ‘century’ adding I think.p.4: missing comma: ‘with the exception of a small number of manuscripts the texts used here are usually print sources drawing, directly or indirectly, from the principles of the Hippocratic-Galenic tradition’. The comma is needed after ‘manuscripts’.p.5 first column: missing comma after ‘opposite effect’.p.5. I think the tense needs to be changed: ‘By contrast, hectic fever has different connotations. It is a very specific pathological condition that is the result…’ – should this be ‘hectic fever had different connotations. It was a very specific pathological…’?p.5. The sentence, ‘This tendency towards the ultimately harmful is usual to envy’ – could be rephrased for clarity- e.g. ‘This tendency to view envy as potentially fatal is usual’.p.5. The quote from the Harley collection needs a little bit more contextualising I think.p.6. The sentence, ‘sorrow is not adequate to describe the experience of envy’ – might need re-phrasing for clarity – e.g. ‘the experience of sorrow was not the same as that of envy’.at the end of the section on language, the relationship between anger and envy is introduced. This could be moved to the start of the next section (on Anger and Envy).p.7: ‘Except for movement of spirits, anger is also connected to heat’. This should be rephrased, as the meaning isn’t quite clear. Do you mean that besides the different movement of spirits, anger was similar to envy in terms of its association with heat?p.11. ‘the idea of humoural imbalance as [the] cause of disease’. (missing ‘the’).p.11, in the section on Helmontians: as Helmontians supposedly didn’t believe in the humours or the qualities they represented, it might seem strange that they could associatae envy with dryness. Maybe comment on this and offer a possible reason. Was it simply too ingrained in the culture of the time not to use?I have read this submission.

et al provides a mechanism to combine ClinVar data downloads into a format that is easier to work with and implement, as ClinVar downloads are either not fully comprehensive individually or too large and complex for the average ClinVar user to use. By including variant frequency information from gnomAD/ExAC, the authors have created a valuable resource for the genetics community. This paper is incredibly timely as more clinical laboratories and researchers utilize ClinVar and population frequency data, but incorrect implementation of data from either source can lead to incorrect filtration and classification. To help user better understand and implement this resource, it may be helpful to change the logic for ""conflicted"" to instead indicate all medically significant conflicts (pathogenic/likely pathogenic versus uncertain significance/likely benign/benign) as opposed to just pathogenic/likely pathogenic versus likely benign/benign. For example, ClinVar variant
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/186876/ has 6 submissions: 1 of Likely pathogenic and 5 of Uncertain significance. To mark the variant as ""1"" for ""pathogenic"" without an indication in the ""conflicted"" column could be misleading as it's not clear that the majority of submitters actually think this variant is of uncertain significance. Alternatively listing the clinical significance terms with counts would help, such as ""Likely pathogenic(1);Uncertain significance(5)"" but perhaps that is not available until ClinVar moves to a variant-centric XML download. Additionally, it may be helpful to move from RCV#s to SCV#s when representing ClinVar records. Users who navigate to an RCV page may not be aware that they are only looking at interpretations regarding a variant/condition pair and not seeing all interpretations submitted for the variant. Also, by listing all SCV#s, it would be clearer to users how many total submissions there are for any given variant. Clarifying that measureset_id = VariationID could also be helpful as many ClinVar users are familiar with the VariationID concept but likely unaware of its name in the XML. Lastly, if possible, it would be incredibly helpful if coverage data from gnomAD/ExAC could be added for variants in ClinVar that are absent from gnomAD/ExAC to help users determine the difference between absent due to poor coverage versus truly absent from tested alleles.I have read this submission.

Plasmodium berghei, a rodent model for malaria. Reverse genetics in
Plasmodium parasites has enjoyed limited success thus far for two reasons: no one-size-fits-all inducible knockout or knockdown system has yet emerged, which makes deletion of essential genes very difficult; and transformation can only be done at blood stage, which makes manipulations across the life cycle awkward to nay impossible for many genes.  To date, no particular conditional gene modification tool has emerged as the obvious protocol of choice.  Thus, further additions to this toolkit, particularly relatively straightforward ones with apparently wide utility, are a welcome addition. This contribution is therefore of very strong value. The authors have generated two options for parental lines. With these other researchers should be able to tag their protein of interest in these parental lines and perform a knock sideways experiment with modest effort. Importantly, they can likely perform this experiment at various points in the parasite life cycle—
in vivo in mice and perhaps mosquitoes, but also
in vitro in blood and sexual stages, and perhaps in
in vitro cultured liver stages. Such versatility is not available in other systems, so this tool is particularly worthwhile. Other inducible knock down systems have proven difficult to apply across the life cycle, particularly with inherent lags between induction and outcome. The rapidity with which the protein of interest can be displaced is thus a very distinct advantage— particularly for ephemeral stages like zygotes and ookinetes—and all kinds of valuable phenotyping scenarios can be contemplated. A key shortcoming of this knock sideways technology, which could be discussed briefly, is that it seems unlikely (as presently constructed) to work for proteins sequestered into compartments such as the apicoplast, mitochondrion, nucleus, endomembrane system [ER/Golgi/food vacuole], the parasitophorous vacuole, or the so-called PEXEL proteins exported to the red cell. Indeed, looking at figure 5D for protein PBANKA_030530 it appears that the nucleolar protein is not displaced at all. In theory, creating different sink locations in other parental lines could open up the possibility of displacing these compartmentalised proteins, but that is perhaps a discussion for another day. Perhaps the authors would like to flag these options for future development of the tool. Another unexplored limitation/advantage is whether the FKBP domain can be used as an N-terminal fusion as an alternative to the currently reported C-terminal fusions. Again, this is something to explore in future and not at all necessary for addition to this first report of efficacy, but the authors might like to point out that there is no conceivable reason why N-terminal tagged proteins couldn't be knocked sideways. One thing that can be clarified is the location of the sink protein (the
P. berghei homologue of the plastid phosphate translocator known as
PfoTPT. Mullin
et al. showed that this multimembrane pass protein resides in the outer membrane of the apicoplast, and this targeting was maintained with either N or C-terminal tagging with triple hemagglutinin epitopes [1]. However, it seems that adding the mCherry and FRB domains on the N-terminus has drastically perturbed this targeting, with essentially all of the sink protein localising to the parasite plasma membrane. This is likely because the tyrosine residue at position 10 in
PfoTPT (position 9 in the
Pb homologue) is essential to apicoplast targeting [2] and appending the sink domains in front of it destroys its context. Happily the N-terminus still apparently projects into the cytosol because the displacement clearly works. Did the authors intend for the sink to be on the outer apicoplast membrane? If so, was this intended to better facilitate KS, and why? I imagine that putting the sink domains at the C-terminus of
PboTPT would result in it being targeted to the apicoplast if that is the desired location, but again I don't think this is required for the current communication. Some minor fixes:

I would like to particularly point out the quantitative imaging approach analyzing co-localization in thousands of cells. I have no major concerns but I would like to ask the authors to discuss the limitations of the method in more depth. Although the method has been proven useful for
in vivo blood stage parasites, most likely it would be of limited use for
in vivo liver stage parasites because rapamycin, in the concentration used, might have very strong effects of parasite liver load as observed in mice treated with similar concentrations (1mg/kg vs. 2,5 mg/kg) (Prado
et al. 2015). This could make the interpretation of the results very difficult. Another point that should be addressed more clearly is that the technology might not be useful for proteins that are secreted or transported into certain cell compartments. Finally, it would be good to discuss the possibility to also use the KS technology in the mosquito to study oocyst development by feeding rapamycin to the mosquitoes infected with the corresponding transgenic parasites.

P. berghei.
 This method of allows tentative protein function to be interrogated by conditionally sequestering the endogenous protein in a non-native cellular localisation. Whilst a variety of conditional systems exist that allow gene product knockdown or knockout, these methodologies can have a significant lag time in efficacy. This can lead to complications in phenotypic interpretations in which secondary effects may occur during the slow depletion of the gene target. Knocksideways has initially been demonstrated to show rapid kinetics and efficacy in mammalian cell types allowing protein sequestration in a timescale of minutes, which mitigates secondary effects. Huges and Waters apply this technology to
P. berghei demonstrating rapid kinetics of efficacy
in vitro and importantly
in vivo on multiple life cycle stages. Overall the study presented is sound and the results justify the conclusions. However, some minor points require clarification and modification. Whilst the authors have demonstrated the rapid kinetics of association between the membrane anchor and protein of interest, they have not looked in detail at the kinetics of reversibility of the rapamycin induced. The data looking at protein association or lack thereof in oocysts formed from rap treated gametocytes gives some indication of this suggesting that the interaction is not long lived i.e. on a scale of days and the loss of association is most likely due to turnover of rap associated complexes in this time frame. It may be of interest to include data in which
in vitro parasites are rap treated to allow complex formation and subsequently loss of association is monitored after rap wash out, granted that this may not be achievable
in vivo. Some of the knocksideways images of parasite proteins are difficult to interpret. For example, PBANKA_093250 is said to re-localise to the periphery of developing merozoites however, in the images presented here only one merozoite structure shows this to some degree of prominence (bottom left hand merozoite). It would be beneficial to include some line profiles of +/- Rap treatment images, as was done for the GFP control in figure 2E, to allow a clearer interpretation of the results. Whilst the authors have mentioned that the CITH knocksideways results do not match the results obtained from the CITH knockout, they suggest that CITH is functional when re-localised. This assumes that re-localisation is complete and it maybe that all of the protein is not fully sequestered which is difficult to tell from co-localisation alone. Following on from this overall suitability of KS to study protein function could be discussed. It may be worth illustrating the suitability of KS to certain gene targets such as enzymes, as re-localisation of these proteins could cause non-native effects due to activity at the site of re-localisation. Some minor spelling and figure labeling: The panel in Figure 5B is shown with coloured fluorescence however the other panels are not, is this for clarity? Worth mentioning in the figure legend.

Plasmodium parasite biology (elegantly reviewed in PMID 25978707) - deleting genes of interest has led to significant insights since the first knockout lines were published twenty years ago (PMID: 9108483 and 9002517). A central problem with the field has always been the question of how to tackle genes that are essential for blood stage growth, which is the stage at which experimental genetic manipulations are carried out. If a gene is essential for blood stage growth, by definition it can not be deleted; this is because
Plasmodium parasites are haploid during blood stage development, so deleting the only copy of an essential gene will kill the parasite before it can be selected for. However, it is the function of these essential genes that are in many cases the most interesting to study. This central conundrum has led to the development and application of numerous conditional technologies to
Plasmodium parasites, allowing functional study of essential genes by disrupting function at the DNA (recombinases such as Cre-loxP, FLP-frt or DiCre), RNA (Tet regulatable transactivators, glmS riboswitch to mediate mRNA degradation) or protein (DD destabilisation domain); PMID 25978707 is a comprehensive source of references for these technologies. All of these conditional approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and while several success stories have been published for each approach, many more attempts that have failed almost certainly sit unpublished in the lab books of PhD students and postdocs around the world. There is as yet no clear one size fits all strategy that means that no further conditional systems are required. This paper adds a new approach, knocksideways, to this expanding conditional genetic toolbox. Used initially to study protein trafficking in mammalian cells, the system relies on rapamycin mediated dimerisation of two protein fragments, one of which is tagged to the protein of interest by genetic manipulation, and the other membrane anchored to a “sink” site such as the plasma membrane. Addition of the small molecule induces dimerisation of the two fragments, and hence mis-localisation of the tagged protein to the sink site, potentially ablating function, depending on how context-dependent the function of the tagged protein is. In the paper, the authors use the rodent
P. berghei model system, which has the twin advantages of being highly genetically tractable and allowing genetic interrogation across the entire life-cycle of the parasite. A proof of principle is developed using fluorescent reporters, and imaging and flow cytometry confirms that relocalisation is efficient and rapid. Utilising the advantages of
P. berghei, the system is validated
in vivo by treating infected mice with rapamycin, and in transmission stages by analysing midguts from infected mosquitoes. Ten endogenous
P. berghei genes were then tagged and the effect of relocalisation on blood-stage growth investigated, along with in one case, the effect on transmission stages. Overall the study is technically sound and clearly demonstrates the broad applicability and utility of the knocksideways approach in
P. berghei, forming a complement to the recent publication of a similar proof of principle which tagged 12 targets in
P. falciparum (PMID: 28288121). The quantification of relocalisation using both confocal microscopy and imaging flow cytometry is a particular strength - colocalisation scores are generated for >6,000 parasites using the latter approach, which lends a robustness to the colocalisation data that is usually lacking in
Plasmodium imaging studies. Validation of the system
in vivo and through mosquito stages is also a significant step, and provides a clear opportunity for work that is not easily accessible in
P. falciparum, where mosquito infections are much more challenging. Technical points that could do with additional clarification include:
Localisation of the anchor appeared different in blood stages and ookinetes, when apical localisation was more apparent in some images (Figure 4D particularly), and also varied somewhat even within blood stages in the multiple strains shown in Figure 5. Co-localisation post-rapamycin treatment was also less compelling in ookinetes, at least as judged by imaging flow cytometry. Has the relative abundance of the anchor between intracellular compartments been quantitated at different stages, and does it differ consistently between lines? Could this affect relocalisation efficiency?The +rap effect seems to wear off by the time oocysts develop - are there any speculative methods to dose infected mosquitoes with rapamycin?One key question is whether mislocalisation is sufficient, in the majority of cases, to impede function. In the 10 proteins studied in Figure 5, one is very clearly expected to be essential, GAP50. Knock sideways of GAP50 clearly has a growth phenotype (Fig 5I), but is this as extensive as would be predicted from complete ablation of an essential protein? Is it possible to calculate the extent of functional reduction based on predicted growth curves for 50% killing, 80% killing, etc?Some comment on the likely scalability and strengths/weaknesses would have been interesting. There are clearly strengths - simple genetic manipulation, rapid mislocalisation. However, a potential weakness is the extent to which mislocalisation ablates function, which will of course be target dependent. Testing on known essential genes, whose products are targeted to different organelles, would be a useful next step.   In summary, a paper with high technical standards that comprehensively introduces a new conditional approach to the

Plasmodium berghei. The KS technique is based on ligand induced heterodimerisation of two domains (FKBP and FRB) and can be used to rapidly remove a protein of interest from its site of action, thereby inactivating it. The power of this conditional protein inactivating method has already been demonstrated in other organisms. As so far no ubiquitously applicable conditional gene or protein inactivation system exists for malaria parasites, this technique adds an important further tool for the study of essential proteins in this parasite. A particular attribute of KS is its speed to inactivate the target which has been shown to avoid compensatory effects that can arise with other gene and protein inactivating approaches (Robinson
et al., Dev Cell 2010). To establish this system in
P. berghei, Huges & Waters first generated parasite lines stably expressing what they term the 'sink' (the part of the heterodimerisation system that sequesters away the protein of interest). For this they use an apicoplast outer membrane protein (that however in most cases was found at the plasma membrane). They carefully evaluate these cell lines and use GFP fused to the second part of the heterodimerisation system to demonstrate rapid and ligand dependent recruitment of GFP to the sink in different parasite stages (including both mouse and mosquito stages). They then go on to test the system with a series of
P. berghei proteins, several of which have not previously been analysed. Growth assays showed that two of these proteins (one of them the IMC protein GAP50) are needed for efficient parasite growth. For GAP50 an Ookinete phenotype was also shown, demonstrating the use of KS to study essential proteins in transmission stages. The strength of the conditional protein inactivation system presented in this paper is its speed and its applicability
in vivo, permitting functional studies in both the mouse and the mosquito. The only small concern I have is that although this paper demonstrates the general applicability of the system in
P. berghei, the efficiency of mislocalisation was somewhat unclear for some of the analysed proteins. Maybe there would be room to further improve the mislocaliser (i.e. the sink). While this is clearly beyond the scope of this paper, it may be a point worth discussing. The authors state that in most cell lines the mislocalisation appeared to be complete and occurred in all visualised parasites. While not practical for all of the targets shown in this paper, it would be nice to have some measure of the efficiency of mislocalisation for some of the proteins where mislocalisation did not seem to be complete (for instance for PBANKA_040140 and PBANKA_093250). The protein with the strongest phenotype, GAP50, may be the most problematic in this respect, as its location at the IMC often is very close to the parasite plasma membrane, which is also the site it is mislocalised to after addition of rapamycin (this is particularly obvious in the ookinete images). While in this case the phenotype indicates successful mislocalisation, this may become an issue with other targets for which no phenotype is observed and it then is unclear whether failure to mislocalise or dispensability of the target is the reason for this. The authors note the possibility to use other mislocalisers and this may solve this problem in the future. Additional small points:
Some of the labels in Figure 5 carry an asterisk but this is not explained in the legend.I would encourage the authors to find a way to increase the size of their microscopy images in the figures (especially Figure 5, but also Figure 4 and others). The details of the images are difficult to see in a regular print out of the paper. There is some dead space that could be used to rearrange the panels to make possible larger images.
 Overall this is an important addition to the tool box to study essential malaria proteins. Some quantification of the mislocalisation levels for a couple of the cell lines could further improve the paper and would be nice to have. Finally, if possible, the size of the microscopy images should be increased.I have read this submission.

1 though co existence of susceptible and resistant strains are not permitted in this model.1.The authors do not claim that this is a model for a disease however I was a little surprising that the resistant strain is eliminated when hand hygiene compliance reaches 55% while coexistence was observed when compliance was 50%. This is over the 5-year period modelled, as presented in Figure S1 and Figure S2. The lower the improvement in hand hygiene, the more gradual the decline in resistant bacteria. Running the model over a 10-year period shows that eventually elimination of the resistant strain will be reached under 50% hand hygiene compliance as well. However, we considered a 5-year time horizon sufficient to illustrate the underlying dynamics. We have added the following text to the result section:“…increasing it further to 55% induced a more rapid decline in both the hospital and community reservoir and successfully eliminated the resistant strainwithin the five year time period simulated.”Minor points:2.The model assumes each hospital is associated with a community of 110,000 – this is OK for Scotland with 42 acute hospitals and a population of 5.2 million.  The average size of each hospital is just under 300 beds.  What would be the impact of smaller hospitals and smaller numbers of health care workers per hospital?With smaller population sizes (and smaller hospitals), stochastic effects would become increasingly important and the relative magnitude of fluctuations in each hospital would increase (in proportion to the reciprocal of the square root of the population size).  Such stochastic effects are not accounted for in our paper as the key intention was to shed light on how hospital interventions could lead to long-term trends in large populations. Stochastic models would lead to the same broad conclusions, but in any given simulation the trends might be obscured by stochastic fluctuations (particularly when populations are small).  We have added the following sentence listed in bold to the discussion:Our model also ignores a lot of host and pathogen heterogeneity
, and we did not account for stochastic effects. In small populations of single hospitals, chance events are likely to play an important role in the transmission dynamics of pathogens. However, we can think of no plausible mechanism by which incorporation of more biological realism would in any way alter our primary conclusion. Though our framework allows for further complexity, the purpose here was to demonstrate that the divergent effects of infection control interventions on resistant and sensitive models could be explained even with a simple model.3. Is the ratio of 100:1000 for health care workers to patients per hospital realistic?The EU FP7 framework RN4cast study surveyed practicing nurses in nine European countries in 2012, and hence provided insight in acute Trust nursing staff ratios in these countries, including England[1,2]
. For England, ~3000 nurses from 31 Trusts, 46 hospitals participated in the study. Patient to nursing staff ratios were highly variable across the sampled Trusts in England, with an overall average of per 1 one patient, 8.8 [Range: 5.5 – 11.5] registered nurses [2]
. Moreover, levels of 1:8 were found during day time and 1:11 during night time on average[1]
. Across all participating countries, the patient-to-nurse ratio was 1:8.3 [2.4 – 17.9] [2]
. We are aware that these figures include nurses only, while not accounting for other healthcare workers. As nurses account for the largest fraction of caring staff, we believe that our patient healthcare worker ratio of 1:10 is not unrealistic. However, we wish to emphasise that lower patient-to-healthcare worker ratios would not change our findings. We have added the above listed references to Table 2.4. 1 in 10 carriage episodes results in an infection – justification. This is the same in hospital and community. However you might expect that immune compromised individuals in hospital who carry a strain might be more likely to develop an infection.Fundamentally, we have presented a model of carriage dynamics and the assumption is that clinical infections increase in line with the number of carriers.  The key results presented do not depend on the proportion of colonized patients who develop an infection. For example, in figure 3, incidence refers to the ""incidence of new acquisitions (symptomatic and asymptomatic) "" and figure 4 also refers to changes in incidence of acquisitions of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection (apologies if this was not clear). The exception is figure 2 where we are attempting to simulate something like the incidence data we observe (i.e. samples submitted to the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust that tested positive for
C. difficile. This hospital does all the
C. difficile testing in Oxfordshire, including samples submitted by GPs, community hospitals and other providers[3]
), though in this case we report only changes in these incidence rates associated with an intervention (i.e. incidence rate ratios) rather than absolute numbers to aid comparison with reference 4.  The net result is the expected values of these IRRs will be insensitive to the risk of clinical infection given carriage in hospital and community, but the absolute numbers (and therefore degree of dispersion) will be sensitive to this. We agree that difference in case mix between hospitalised individuals and individuals residing in the community might lead to a difference in likelihood of developing infection. In addition, hospital-acquired
C. difficile cases are probably more likely to be reported than community-acquired cases.  Indeed, this may explain why the simulations are giving wider dispersion for the IRR for hospital linked cases than observed data but somewhat narrower dispersion for the community linked cases (for which we may be overestimating the proportion seen in hospital). To address this issue we allowed for different constants of proportionality for hospital and community-linked infections, and, by default, assumed that hospital-acquired cases were 5 times more likely to be reported as community-acquired cases. Figure 2 has been updated accordingly.In addition, the method section now reads:“We assumed the number of new infections reported with a hospital link or a community was proportional to the cumulative number of acquisitions in the hospital
or community in each of the two time periods”In explaining our calculated observed infections we now say:“…and assuming 1 in 10 carriage episodes acquired in hospital resulted in a reported infection. This was 1 in 50 for community-acquired episodes. Hence we allowed for differences in reporting rates in both settings as well as heterogeneity in case-mix affecting the likelihood of developing an infection.”Moreover, we have changed the caption of Figure 4 in line with figure 3, the caption now reads:“Annual incidence rate ratios of new acquisitions (symptomatic and asymptomatic) associated with an infection control intervention under different levels of adaptation of sensitive and resistant strains to hospital and community settings”References:1.

In this theoretical study, a new deterministic model based on ODEs is numerically simulated under different hand hygiene scenarios. For each scenario, the resulting annual incidence ratio is calculated for hospital- and community-acquired infections with resistant and sensitive bacteria. The simulation results suggest that, counter-intuitively but in accordance to the observations from recent years, infection control interventions such as hand hygiene can have discordant effects on resistant and sensitive strains, even if they do not target specifically one or the other. This is a very clear and well written article and I really enjoyed reading it. The question addressed is of high importance in a context where antimicrobial resistance keeps increasing and limited number of drugs and interventions are available to control it. Understanding better the respective impact of control measures is therefore essential to optimize their implementations and also interpret the observed trends. However, to make the presented results more convincing and interpretable, some clarification about the model is needed, in addition to sensitivity analysis on the model parameters.Main commentsModelling health care workers (HCW) colonisation. An originality of the model is that it specifically formalizes the patient-HCW transmission. Here, HCWs are classified either as non-hand-carriers or as hand-carriers. In the model, hand hygiene is therefore assumed to directly impact to directly clear HCW carriage in compliant individuals (eg at a proportion of 50%). Several epidemiological studies have shown that, in the case of S. aureus at least, proper (nasal) colonization is frequent in HCW. I would expect that, for those HCW properly carrying the bacteria, efficient hand hygiene may impede transmission to others by clearing hand carriage, but would not clear colonisation. They would not need to be recolonized through contact with patients to become again S or R carriers the next day. On the contrary, for purely transient hand carriers HCWs, I would expect that hand hygiene completely removes the bacteria from the hand and entire body. In that case, new acquisition from patient would be necessary for them to become carrier again. Can the authors comment on that point? In particular, how is HCW’s duration of carriage handled in the model?Parameters table. The table needs some clarifications and references. (1) I did not understand the values of the following rates: tau, gammaR, and gammaS: is the rate or the duration depicted in the last column? It looks more like the reciprocal duration, despite the unit is given in day-1. (2) I think a % is lacking in the last raw of the table. (3) Can you please explain the calculation of f23, this is not clear to me. (4) If I understand well, carriage is assumed to last for 400 days. This is quite long and may have consequences on the resulting trends obtained in the simulations. Can the authors provide a justification for this value and carry out some sensitivity analysis on this parameter? (5) Can you provide some justification about the values of p set to 10? Bacterial interference. This is not clear whether the authors finally assumed some competition for colonisation between the strains or not. On the schematic representation of the model, no “superinfection” is assumed, but this mechanism is described in the Methods section. If w=0 as indicated in Table2, then full competition is assumed between the strains. This hypothesis is strong and may have some influence on the resulting trends. My intuition is that this strong assumption may provide more chance to S strains to spread in hospitals when R strains are removed by intervention. Could the authors carry out some sensitivity analysis on the impact of that parameter?Transmission rate. Could you provide more details about beta calculation for the different strains in the different settings according to R0? Also, in the section “Importance of the degree of strain adaptation…”, “when increasing the transmission that occurs in hospital”, could you provide the corresponding values for beta? Similarly, when investigating the importance of environmental adaptation, how did you process to vary “the level of transmission in both settings for each of the two strains, while keeping the overall basic reproduction number for R and S strains constant…”?Model equations. Frequency dependent hypothesis is assumed in the ward which looks realistic. However, in some equations, this rule does not apply; it would require some explanation. In equations describing the hcwS and hcwR derivatives, the denominator of the transmission term is for example Nhcw.Community transmission. The expressions of the force of infections for patients are not totally clear to me either. In particular, I don’t understand the term beta_R3xR3xf23/N2. Given the definition of f23, this expression is actually equivalent to beta_R3xR3/N3, which makes more sense to me. In general, it would be good if more details were provided to explain the model community transmission. It was not clear to me what the authors meant by “the model allowed for the possibility of assortative mixing within population 2 and 3”. Could you provide a mixing matrix to make clear the transmission between the 3 (or 4) populations? Similarly, expressions of lambda_R3, lambda_S1, lambda_S2 and lambda_S3 would need some more explanation. Why is it divided respectively by N3, N2 and N3?Annual incidence rate ratio. Could you provide an equation for the calculation of IRR as a function of the measured outputs from the results?Interpretation of results about the dynamic after hospital infection control. To make the interpretation of Figure 3 more convincing, it would be important to disentangle what processes come from the community- to-community transmission, the hospital- to-community (ie community importations) transmission, the hospital- to-hospital transmission and the community-to-hospital (ie hospital importations) transmission. Could the authors present, in addition to Figure3, the incident cases coming from these different processes?The modelled hospital population is 1000 patients and 100 HCWs. The proposed model is deterministic. How would stochasticity impact the results?  Minor commentsDoes R0 define the number of secondary cases of infection or colonisation? As transmission occurs through colonization my choice would go for that one but in the main text and Table 2 legend, the authors mention “infection”. In addition, as R0 is actually defined in a setting with already 40% hand hygiene at baseline, this is actually not the strict basic reproductive number of the bacteria. I therefore suggest naming it reproductive number (R) which seems more correct to me.Table1. hCWR and hCWS notations do not match with notations in the model depicted in fig1.

In that case, new acquisition from patient would be necessary for them to become carrier again. Can the authors comment on that point? In particular, how is HCW’s duration of carriage handled in the model? We recognise that both types of carriage have been found among healthcare workers, at least in the case of MRSA. A review of the literature [4]
 revealed a wide array of studies with some finding persistent carriage to be more common, whereas other studies concluded transient carriage is the most frequent type of carriage among healthcare workers. The findings of these studies are likely to be setting dependent and, as concluded by Albrich and Harbarth [4]
, sensitive to misclassification bias (e.g. incorrectly defining transient carriage as persistent carriage), and are, in any case, not informative about the significance of longer-term staff carriage for hospital transmission dynamics. In this model, we assumed that persistent carriage by healthcare workers does not play a significant role in hospital transmission and can be neglected. Clearly, as with other model assumptions, this is a simplification, and we acknowledge that there are case reports of outbreaks with a plausible link to long-term staff carriers. However, our assumption is supported by a prospective carriage study of MRSA in adult and paediatric ICUs using whole genome sequencing to determine possible transmission pathways [5]
. This study showed frequent patient acquisition events of MRSA with closely related strains shared between overlapping patients, strongly suggesting patient-to-patient transmission. In contrast, while MRSA was recovered from nasal swabs from four healthcare workers, there was only a single patient MRSA acquisition that could have been plausibly related to known staff carriage (based on the whole genome sequencing data). Since patients were not mobile, patient-to-patient transmission events are likely to represent either hand-borne or air-borne transmission. Studies from the 1960s suggest that the latter plays a relatively minor role in
S. aureus transmission in hospital settings (see, for example, [6,7]
). Since the purpose of our model is to illustrate the potential differential effects of infection control measures on sensitive and resistant strains (and not to make strong claims for potential impact of different control measures), for simplicity we chose to focus on what appears to be the dominant mode of transmission (at least for
S. aureus, other organisms are less well studied) rather than adding non-essential complexity by accounting for other transmission pathways.  Therefore, following hand hygiene, healthcare worker carriage is cleared and new contact with contaminated patients is required for healthcare workers to become carriers again. Persistent colonization such as the nasal colonization the reviewer is referring to is not included in this model. Hence no explicit colonization time for healthcare workers is assumed. We have now added the following sentence to our methods:“Persistent carriage of bacteria such as MRSA has been reported among healthcare workers, though is commonly found to be transient”. Followed by the text already present: “
Therefore, healthcare workers in turn were assumed to become transiently contaminated through patient contact. Hand hygiene performed by a contaminated healthcare worker was assumed to clear this contamination”In addition, we have added the following text to our discussion:Moreover, for simplicity we chose to focus on what appears to be the dominant mode of transmission (at least for S. aureus, other organisms are less well studied). Since hospitalised patients are generally not mobile, patient-to-patient transmission events represent either hand-borne or air-borne transmission. Studies from the 1960s suggest that the latter plays a relatively minor role in S. aureus transmission in hospital settings [24,25].”Parameters table. The table needs some clarifications and references. (1) I did not understand the values of the following rates: tau, gammaR, and gammaS: is the rate or the duration depicted in the last column? It looks more like the reciprocal duration, despite the unit is given in day-1. (2) I think a % is lacking in the last raw of the table.

This is quite long and may have consequences on the resulting trends obtained in the simulations.

We thank the author for spotting this error, the last column should indeed depict the rates for tau, gammaR and gammaS. We have now changed the values to reflect the reciprocal duration. The % sign is now added to the last row of table 2  See comment 6We belief 400 days of carriage is a plausible value to represent the dynamics of MRSA. For example, Scanvic et al, CID 2001 found a median duration of carriage of 8.5 months among patients readmitted to hospital, following an exponential distribution[8]
. This would result in an average duration of: y
in = (8.5/12)*365*1/log(2) = 373 days.For other major pathogens this is less well known, but, in the case of for example
C. difficile, likely to be shorter. Our key results however, are not affected by this; in Van Kleef et al LID 2017[9]
 we show an example where we assumed a shorter duration of carriage (200 days) and were able to produce similar findings and conclusions. We feel that presenting additional sensitivity analysis here would make the paper harder to read and potentially obscure the key message.However,we have added a reference to our analysis using different parameter values, including a shorter duration of carriage [9]
 to the discussion:“For example, assumptions about carriage duration, mixing of community populations, and the degree of bacterial interference between the two strains can easily be altered (and will not change our main conclusions, as shown in respectively [20], Figure S3, Figure S4)”Furthermore, we added the reference of Scanvic et al to table 2.The rational behind the different transmission probabilities of patients and healthcare workers relates to our assumption explained under comment 1. We assume that healthcare workers were transiently hand-carriers of bacterial pathogens, whereas patients were fully colonised. For patients, this could be e.g. on the skin, wounds or nasal carriage. We translated these different degrees of carriage in different risks of transmission.We fully agree with the reviewer that a justified value for
p based on scientific evidence would be important if we were interested in quantifying effects of hand hygiene interventions specifically. However, we are just using hand hygiene as a specific example of an intervention that interrupts transmission in the hospital but not the community for resistant and sensitive strains equally.To make the latter clearer, we have added the following in bold to our introduction:“We explicitly model a hospital hand hygiene intervention
as an example of a non-specific infection control measure and evaluate the impact of this intervention on the incidence of hospital and community acquisitions of antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive strains.”
Bacterial interference. This is not clear whether the authors finally assumed some competition for colonisation between the strains or not. On the schematic representation of the model, no “superinfection” is assumed, but this mechanism is described in the Methods section. If w=0 as indicated in Table2, then full competition is assumed between the strains. This hypothesis is strong and may have some influence on the resulting trends. My intuition is that this strong assumption may provide more chance to S strains to spread in hospitals when R strains are removed by intervention. Could the authors carry out some sensitivity analysis on the impact of that parameter?e apologies that we did not make our assumptions regarding bacterial inference clear in our manuscript. We do assume competition for colonization between strains. This is specified by the parameters w
sand w
r (see table 2) which by default were set to 0 (implying carriage of one strain completely blocks acquisition of another i.e. complete bacterial interference). In response to this comment we have now conducted an additional sensitivity analysis where we assume w
S,w
R = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 respectively. The results are presented in Figure S3.We find that at lower levels of bacterial interference (i.e. higher ω
sand ω
R), the incidence of the resistant strain in both the hospital and the community is higher compared to baseline, whereas the incidence of the sensitive strain is lower in both settings (Figure S3). This relates to the higher R
n of the resistant strain, giving it a competitive advantage over the sensitive strain, which is further enhanced when replacement infection is allowed for. At w
S,w
R = 1, this means the sensitive strain does not coexist with the resistant at baseline hand hygiene levels of 40%. However, after implementation of the hand hygiene intervention, the sensitive strain will emerge even under these conditions. Thus, what is shown is that regardless of the level of bacterial interference, the overall conclusions remain unchanged: hospital infection control can have discordant effects on resistant and sensitive bacteria provided heterogeneity is present in their respective environmental adaptations.Just to clarify, while we do consider competition we do not consider superinfection (i.e. co-infection with both sensitive and resistant strains[10]
) and we state this in the methods section “
Individuals could not be co-infected with resistant and sensitive strains”. Including this would greatly add to the complexity of the model, reduce readability and, we feel, obscure the key messages.We have added the following text in bold to the discussion section:“For example, assumptions about carriage duration and the degree of bacterial interference between the two strains can easily be altered
(and will not change our main conclusions, Lancet ID paper, Figure S3, Figure S4)”Moreover, we have added the term ‘replacement infection’ to our methods, which now reads:“we allowed for bacterial interference between the two strains so that colonization with one strain reduced the risk of acquisition of the other strain, i.e. replacement infection”.Transmission rate. Could you provide more details about beta calculation for the different strains in the different settings according to R0? Also, in the section “Importance of the degree of strain adaptation…”, “when increasing the transmission that occurs in hospital”, could you provide the corresponding values for beta?Similarly, when investigating the importance of environmental adaptation, how did you process to vary “the level of transmission in both settings for each of the two strains, while keeping the overall basic reproduction number for R and S strains constant…”?We varied the values of beta_R
n (where n = population 1, population 2, population 3)to give values of R0 = 1.5 an beta_R
s to give values of R0 = 1.4 keeping all other parameter values constant and ran the model at equilibrium. If at model equilibrium, the strain adaptation to each of the respective environments was at the desirable level, these values were chosen for model parameterisation. Here, the degree of strain adaptation was defined as the fraction of new acquisitions of strain i occurring in setting n (hospital or community) respectively on each day t.The corresponding values for all beta_i
n used to produce figure 4 are available at
https://github.com/esthervankleef/Two_strain_model_published. We have added the following text in bold to the method section:“Increasing adaptation of the resistant strain to the hospital environment (i.e. increasing the proportion of resistant transmission that occurs in hospital

 and all other parameters constant),Also, we added the following text to the legend of Figure 4.“For corresponding transmission parameter values see https://github.com/esthervankleef/Two_strain_model_published”Model equations. Frequency dependent hypothesis is assumed in the ward which looks realistic. However, in some equations, this rule does not apply; it would require some explanation. In equations describing the hcwS and hcwR derivatives, the denominator of the transmission term is for example Nhcw.The reason why the denominator for hcw
S and hcw
R derivatives is N
hcw follows from the structure of our model, which assumes healthcare workers are the pathogen vectors.  Similar to Cooper et al (1999)[11]
 we assume that in hospital, all transmission events between patients is caused by a contact from a transiently colonized HCW. Similarly, HCW acquire transient hand-contamination only by touching colonized patients.In our model, beta_R
1 = the probability that an uncolonized patient becomes colonized on contact with a colonized healthcare worker, whereas p*beta_R
1 = the probability that an uncolonized healthcare worker becomes colonized with a resistant strain on contact with a colonized patient (where rho = ratio of probability of patient-to-HCW transmission vs HCW-to-patient transmission).Hence, the rates at which contacts are made which can potentially result in colonization with a resistant strain is beta_R
1*U
1for patients (i.e. a function of beta_R
1 and the number of uncolonized patients U
1), and p*beta_R
1*R
1 for healthcare workers (i.e. a function of p
, beta_R
1 andthe number of colonized patients R
1). Only a fraction of these contacts will result in transmission. For patients this is the fraction of contacts which are with colonized healthcare workers (hcw­
R/N
hcw)
. For healthcare workers, it is those contacts in which the healthcare worker is uncolonized that will result in transmission (N
hcw – hcw
R – hcw

, further explained under comment 6.Of note: the parameter p was left out of equations 10 and 11, and has now been added.Community transmission. The expressions of the force of infections for patients are not totally clear to me either. In particular, I don’t understand the term beta_R3xR3xf23/N2. Given the definition of f23, this expression is actually equivalent to beta_R3xR3/N3, which makes more sense to me. In general, it would be good if more details were provided to explain the model community transmission. It was not clear to me what the authors meant by “the model allowed for the possibility of assortative mixing within population 2 and 3”. Could you provide a mixing matrix to make clear the transmission between the 3 (or 4) populations? Similarly, expressions of lambda_R3, lambda_S1, lambda_S2 and lambda_S3 would need some more explanation. Why is it divided respectively by N3, N2 and N3?This is a good point. We recognize that our baseline assumptions regarding the mixing of our population need further clarification.In our description of the force of infection, we followed the definition of Otto and Day, who decompose the frequency dependent incidence rate, i.e. the rate at which new infections occur, in three components [12]
:The rate of contact with other individuals in the population (
c) which are of an appropriate type for transmission to be possible if one of the hosts is infectiousThe probability that the contact is indeed with a susceptible host U (
p, assumed to be U(t)/N(t))The probability that a contact between an infectious and susceptible host leads to successful transmission (
v)In the case of frequency dependent transmission, c is assumed constant, hence the effective contact rate or transmission coefficient beta = cv. Assuming frequency dependent transmission, and the definition of Otto and Day, the mixing matrix for the community population should be as follows, where the beta terms are equivalent to the effective contact rates, and e.g. f
23/beta_R
3reflects that the effective contact rate between individuals of population 2 and population 3 is a fraction of the effective contact rate between individuals in population 3.Equation 1Multiplying these by the number of infected individuals in each population and the probability
p
ithat the contact is indeed with a susceptible host (U
Ri /N
i) would result in the following incidence rates:Equation 2As our lambdas represent the force of infections, i.e. the rate at which a susceptible individual becomes infected, we replaced p
i of the incidence rates with the probability that the contact is with one specific susceptible host, i.e.  
and
, resulting in:
Equation 3The same logic applies to lambda_S
2 andlambda_S
3.We realise our description of the f
23 and f
32 in table 2 was not entirely correct and would be better described as given below. Moreover, the reference of our frequency dependent transmission has been added to the method section, which now reads:“We assumed frequency-dependent transmission [10]. The model allowed for the possibility of assortative mixing within populations 2 and 3, where the effective contact rate of strain i (beta_in) between individuals within a population is a fraction of the effective contact rate between individuals across populations: “Equation 4We have changed the description of f
23 and f
32 in Table 2 to:f23 = The ratio of the effective contact rate in N2 from someone in N3 to the effective contact rate in N3 from someone in N3 (where 1 implies that on contact, someone in N3 is causing new infections in N3 and N2 at the same rate. Of note, as N3 > N2, f23 = N2/N3 assumes the same per capita infection rate, i.e. homogenous mixing.f32 = The ratio of the effective contact rate in N3 from someone in N2 to the successful contact rate in N2 from someone in N2 (where 1 implies that on contact, someone in N2 is causing new infections in N2 and N3 at the same rate. Of note, as N3 > N2, f32 = N3/N2 assumes the same per capita infection rate, i.e. homogenous mixing.With regards to our assortative mixing assumption, as described in the above definitions, by defining f23 = N2/N3 and f32 = 1, we assume that individuals in N3 are equally likely to infect an individual in N2 as they are to infect a given individual in N3, whereas setting f32 to 1 implies a higher per capita rate of infection in N2, given N2 < N3, thus individuals in N2 are more likely to infect an individual in N2 than an individual in N3.   Baseline values of these parameters were chosen to reflect perceived heterogeneities in contacts (e.g. assuming a scenario of LTCFs (N2) vs the general population (N3) where those in N2 will be exposed preferentially to those in N2, but, considering some in N3 will be carers to N2, N3 will mix equally with N2 and N3. These assumptions are not critical to our results, as shown bya sensitivity analysis, where we modelled the following additional scenarios:Fully homogenous mixing (f23 = N2/N3, f32 = N3/N2)Fully assortative mixing (f23= f32=0) The results of this analysis are presented in Figure S4. We have added the following text to the discussion section:“For example, assumptions about carriage duration and the degree of bacterial interference between the two strains can easily be altered
(and will not change our main conclusions, Lancet ID paper, Figure S3, Figure S4)”Annual incidence rate ratio. Could you provide an equation for the calculation of IRR as a function of the measured outputs from the results?The annual incidence ratio represents the ratio of the number of new infection in the year pre-intervention (T
0) to the number of new cases in the first year post-intervention (T­
1). As mentioned in the method section, Y
in represents the actual number of observed infections of strain i in population n, which is proportional to the cumulative number of acquisitions in each population in these two time periods.We have now changed the methods section ‘measuring the impact of hospital infection control’ to the following:“Annual incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using simulated data for one year pre- and post-intervention (T
0 and T
1 respectively) after first running the model to equilibrium. To aid comparison with reported infection data, we assumed the number of new infections (Y
in) with and without a hospital link was proportional to the cumulative number of acquisitions (I
in) in the hospital and community, respectively, in each of the two time periods:Equation 5Confidence intervals were calculated using 1000 Monte Carlo replicates on the assumption that the actual number of observed infections of each strain (Y
in) followed a negative binomial distribution where Var(Y
in) = µ+ µ
2/k, with k (the dispersion parameter) = µ/( - 1), with  = 5, and assuming 1 in 10 carriage episodes acquired in hospital resulted in a reported infection. This was 1 in 50 for community-acquired episodes. Hence we allowed for differences in reporting rates in both settings as well as heterogeneity in case-mix affecting the likelihood of developing an infection. Then the IRR
in corresponded to the ratio of the number of new observed infections of strain i in population n in the year pre-intervention to the number in the first year post-intervention:”Equation 6Interpretation of results about the dynamic after hospital infection control. To make the interpretation of Figure 3 more convincing, it would be important to disentangle what processes come from the community- to-community transmission, the hospital- to-community (ie community importations) transmission, the hospital- to-hospital transmission and the community-to-hospital (ie hospital importations) transmission. Could the authors present, in addition to Figure3, the incident cases coming from these different processes?We fully agree that it is helpful to show where the transmission events are actually occurring and this is what we are depicting in the top row of figure 3 - i.e. community-to-community transmission (dashed line) and hospital-to-hospital transmission (dotted line). The model assumes that community-to-hospital and hospital-to-community transmission events do not occur (we do not depict importation events of colonized patients to the hospital as these simply scale with community prevalence and would provide no new information). We apologies that the caption to figure 3 did not make this clear and we have now revised it:“Trends in the incidence of new acquisitions (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and carriage prevalence for resistant and sensitive bacterial strains following a 10% stepwise improvement in hand hygiene compliance after one year from a baseline of 40%.Incidence trends are depicted as transmission events following from community-to-community transmission (dashed line) and hospital-to-hospital transmission (dotted line). As prevalence in the hospital represents only a small fraction of the overall prevalence (in hospital and community populations combined), the latter is almost identical to the community prevalence for both the resistant and sensitive bacterial strains.”The modelled hospital population is 1000 patients and 100 HCWs. The proposed model is deterministic. How would stochasticity impact the results?See the response to comment 1 reviewer #1  Minor commentsDoes R0 define the number of secondary cases of infection or colonisation? As transmission occurs through colonization my choice would go for that one but in the main text and Table 2 legend, the authors mention “infection”. In addition, as R0 is actually defined in a setting with already 40% hand hygiene at baseline, this is actually not the strict basic reproductive number of the bacteria. I therefore suggest naming it reproductive number (R) which seems more correct to me.In our model and the manuscript through out, R0 is considered the expected number of secondary cases in the hospital and community resulting from one colonised individual in a fully uncolonized and susceptible population at baseline hand hygiene rates of 40%, accounting for the possibility of readmissions while still colonized. The text in Table 2 has now been altered to reflect colonisation instead of infection. Moreover, we have altered R0 has now been changed to R
n (the net reproduction number) across the manuscript.Table1. hCWR and hCWS notations do not match with notations in the model depicted in fig1. Could the authors check they use the same notations?Many thanks for this sharp observation. We have now updated figure 1, which now matches our notation in Table 1. References1.

The author uses this case history to explore 'the economy of celebrity' in the mid-20th century, looking at the ways in which the psychiatrist David Stafford-Clark exploited the growing cultural authority of psychiatry in the 1950s and early 1960s at a time when the expansion of broadcasting created opportunities for white, male, middle-aged public intellectuals endowed with cultural gravitas from their expertise in another sphere. The article analyses Stafford-Clark's role in promoting psychiatry as a legitimating force even on topics on which it - and he - had little or no expertise. He thus became a vector for medicalisation - paradoxically, even on subjects such as homosexuality where he argued against a medicalised view. The article shows, with great skill, how Stafford-Clark's self-aggrandising project was eventually the cause of his undoing, positioning him no longer as an expert but now as a quasi- or ersatz- broadcaster, albeit one who did not conform to the norms of the medium in his propensity to moralise or talk at the audience. The article makes a valuable contribution, therefore, to the history of the medical profession in broadcasting and the difficulties they faced in reconciling conflicting imperatives. If I may I'd like to suggest that Stafford-Clark's career could be contrasted with that of the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott. Although Winnicott broadcast over the radio and not television, through the fifty radio broadcasts that he made between 1943 and 1962 he also attained fame beyond the consulting-room, yet he scrupulously avoided Stafford-Clark's moralising tone. He also refrained from intervening over the airwaves in controversial debates, despite being outspoken on subjects such as leucotomy in the medical press, and thus protected his professional reputation
1. Miller is bold in his critique of Stafford-Clark's increasingly narcissistic relationship with broadcasting and provides ample evidence to substantiate it.

David Stafford-Clark is brought to life as an intriguing character through impressive original research and provocative and intelligent analysis. The essay draws on Stafford-Clark’s voluminous scattered publications, but also his revealing personal papers and the records on his radio and television contributions held in the BBC written archives. Listings of Stafford-Clark’s publications and broadcast output are both included with the essay and will be of value to future research. Stafford-Clark has attracted little previous attention, but as the essay clearly demonstrates he was in fact a significant figure in post-war British public life. In explaining how this came about, and in uncovering what Stafford-Clark did with this position, Miller helps us to understand how psychiatry developed a public face in post-war Britain and explains convincingly the difficulties that arose in combining the roles of expert psychiatrist and public intellectual (which would resurface in the better known public life of R.D. Laing in the years that followed). We are led towards this understanding through analysis of Stafford-Clark’s publishing career (including his efforts to develop the reputation as a poet) and even more crucially through his rise (and fall) as ‘the BBC psychiatrist’. This is a richly detailed and well told biographical story based on excellent research. The essay is also an important contribution in bringing psychiatry into the broader story of the intellectual life of the post-war nation, and it engages with an impressive range of secondary literature in opening up this subject. It is work therefore that deserves the attention not just of historians of medicine, psychiatry and the development of a psychological society, but also of a broader body of historians interested in the impact of the social sciences, the media, secularisation, and the emergence of a permissive society in post-war Britain.

et al. have made for Lived Lives project. I enjoyed reading this manuscript, and it is a beautifully written document which well illustrates the process and needs of this research. While studying community engaged suicide intervention, this project is innovative, creative, and powerful. As authors indicated in the manuscript, suicide intervention can refer to any efforts to bring about change to reduce suicidal behavior in individuals and within communities. Through having the arts-science collaboration and getting the bereaved families involved in this project, it opened up the door to discuss one of the most stigmatizing topics of human experiences: suicide. In order to reduce the suicidal behavior of the community, the community has to gain a collective understanding of the impacts and  the contextual factors of suicide as well as the targeted initiatives and policies that take the particular community’s specific and special needs into consideration. Furthermore, the majority of suicide prevention neglects “targeted” and “tailored” intervention and continues to assume “one size fits all policy.” Dr. Malone and Mr. McGuinness targeted “Irish Travellers”, the vulnerable, under-studied, and under-served population. They adapted their Lived Lives work to fit this community’s voices so that it can better foster the open conversation about the taboo topics around mental health, suicide, and barriers. They also aimed to raise the awareness of this community's problem (the perpetual cycle of grief) to the public as well as its own “Irish Travellers” community. After reading this manuscript, I can envision that Lived Lives project can be adapted to other ethnic minority populations (e.g, Asian-Americans, African-Americans) in any international countries or communities. However, there are several comments to improve this paper.
In the Introduction, I suggest that the information regarding “Irish Travellers” should come to the front. More statistics regarding the suicide rates and  mental health functioning data compared to their counterparts will strengthen the significance of this study.On page 4, “Nowadays they are frequently under-served and excluded from health research, confounding intervention.”  I do not understand what the authors  mean by “confounding intervention”. It will be helpful if the authors can clarify this point by re-writing this sentence.While the evaluation of the project is simple and crude, I recommend the authors to come up with a more rigorous evaluation process for the future Lived Lives work with other populations. I believe this part should be added in the future direction section.

While it is able to corroborate earlier findings by others, it also provides an extensive amount of new data and sheds light on species-dependent differences in organogenesis. Despite these achievements, there are concerns that should be addressed in order to improve the quality of the data and make the presented arguments more scientifically sound. There are two major concerns that should be addressed to a satisfactory extent. Firstly, the main concern of the manuscript is data validation. Novel findings based on microarray data should always be confirmed using another method, such as qPCR and/or immunohistochemical staining (as the authors have done for the adrenal data: Fig4 and Fig 5). At many points in the manuscript (p8, p11, p25, p27) the authors propose that co-enrichment with known markers associated with distinct biological processes or monogenic disorders validates the data. This is, however, at best merely correlative data and provides only weak validation. It would greatly improve the quality of the research if the authors would validate the data at least for the most important candidate genes using qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry. The authors have included a good selection of immunohistochemical stainings but they are partially a cause for concern in their own right (see below) plus fail to provide sufficient validation for the data. The latter statement might sound harsh but in order to validate microarray data the authors need to provide at least two stainings: one that shows low/no expression at a specific time point (say CITED1 in the early testis) and high expression in another time point (CITED1 in late testis). Including this kind of data would be sufficient to address this concern and would provide the minimum acceptable validation for the microarray findings. Strictly speaking IHC does not validate microarray data as it visualizes proteins, not RNA, but at the end it is the protein expression that we are interested in and in most cases microarray/RNAseq/qPCR are just tools to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs that are translated into proteins. The second major concern is the quality of immunohistochemical stainings. Particularly lack of negative control stainings and difficulty to interpret the data due to inappropriate magnification and/or absence of high magnification insets. Please include negative control stainings at least for the novel markers. Provide high magnification inset for the following figures: Fig.4c top and middle panel, Fig.12c and Fig.12d. Due to poor quality, please consider providing an alternative image of higher magnification or after cropping (+inset) for Fig.12d and Fig.13d top panel.  Minor points:

Strictly speaking IHC does not validate microarray data as it visualizes proteins, not RNA, but at the end it is the protein expression that we are interested in and in most cases microarray/RNAseq/qPCR are just tools to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs that are translated into proteins.We agreed that further validation would be ideal at both the RNA level (qRTPCR) and protein level (immunohistochemistry), but we tried to focus on the key new genes described and were limited by the specificity of antibodies for IHC for some genes/protein of interest. We did focus largely on IHC data as we felt this provided validation at the protein level as well as RNA, but agree we could have included more validation across the time series (some of which we omitted because of space).To address these issues, we have:1) Provided qRTPCR data for validation of key upregulated testis genes (CITED1, ZNF280B, PRPS2, ANKRD18A) in the testis versus control samples. We also show changes in expression level across three time points (CS18, CS23, 10 wpc). These data are now shown as Supplementary Figure 1 and details have been added to the methods.2) Provided qRTPCR data for upregulation of key novel steroidogenic components (GRAMD1B, FOXO4, MAP3K15, RMDN2) across time points before and after the onset of steroidogenesis (CS21, 8.5 wpc). These data are now shown as Supplementary Figure 2a and details have been added to the methods.3) Unfortunately we do not have IHC data for CITED1 across time, but we have shown clear sequential upregulation by qRTPCR as described above (Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, we have analysed available data from single-cell transcriptomics in human gonad development recently published by Li
et al. (Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis Maps Development of Human Germline Cells and Gonadal Niche Interactions.

Cell Stem Cell. 2017 Jun 1;20(6):858-873.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2017.03.007). We analysed all cells from 46,XY embryos/foetuses between 4 and 19 weeks gestation that cover the time course of interest (1207 single cells). Using a cut-off of >0.5 TPM to indicate expressed genes, we found that 221/1014 [21%] of SOX9 negative cells co-expressed CITED1, whereas 97/193 [50%] of SOX9 positive cells co-expressed CITED1 (Chi-squared 66.2, df =1, p-value < 4e
-16). Furthermore, Cited1 was identified within developing Sertoli cells in recently available data from mouse single-cell transcriptomics, with an expression time course shortly after SOX9 (Deciphering cell lineage specification during male sex determination with single-cell RNA sequencing.

We feel that these are additional novel, independent data to show the potential link between SOX9 and CITED1 in testis development. 4) We now provide sequential IHC data for GRAMD1B and RMDN2 before and after the onset of steroidogenesis to show an increase in protein expression in the cytoplasm of Leydig cells (Supplementary Figure 2b).Please note that in the original manuscript we have included links to the Human Protein Atlas for many key novel factors. This resource provides IHC data for adult tissues as well as graphical data for qPCR datasets (e.g. FANTOM5, GTEx).The second major concern is the quality of immunohistochemical stainings. Particularly lack of negative control stainings and difficulty to interpret the data due to inappropriate magnification and/or absence of high magnification insets.

Due to poor quality, please consider providing an alternative image of higher magnification or after cropping (+inset) for Fig.12d and Fig.13d top panel.Negative control data are particularly important to assess binding of secondary antibodies and non-specific effects. We include representative negative data in Supplementary Figure 3b. Moreover, all of the IHC images shown include areas of negative staining (e.g. capsule, non-endocrine tissue) which are important internal negative controls for the primary antibody. The main aim of Fig. 4c (upper and middle panels) was to show the distribution of the factors within the adrenal in general, but not in the capsule. Higher power magnification of SF-1/NR5A1 in the adrenal gland is shown in Fig. 12c and in the new Supplementary Figure 3a, but we feel that including it as an inset would be too crowded. We have included a higher power images of Fig. 12c (GRAMD1B, RMND2 in the adrenal gland) in Supplementary Figure 3a. We have added a higher magnification image of FOXO4 staining of nuclei into Figure 12d as an additional panel as requested, which shows co-expression of FOXO4 and NR5A1 in nuclei of Leydig cells. Unfortunately we are unable to provide a better quality image for 13d (upper panel) but a higher power magnification is shown. Minor points:P8, left column, row 12 from top.

Gutiérrez, Buenos Aires, Argentina",approve,"The comprehension of the mechanisms underlying adrenal and gonadal development in the first trimester of intrauterine life is essential for the understanding of human congenital disorders. Most of the information available on normal embryonic and fetal development of the adrenals and gonads derives from studies in experimental models. This study provides crucial insight into the comprehension of these developmental processes in humans. In fact, by performing microarray studies on tissues obtained from accurately staged embryos and fetuses to assess time-series changes and differential expression patterns, del Valle and colleagues have constructed an atlas of RNA expression in the adrenals, testes and ovaries from 6 to 10 weeks post-conception, a critical period in the differentiation of these organs. The authors validate their findings using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry of genes known to be important in adrenal and gonadal development. The expression profiles of known genes were corroborated whereas unknown profiles of genes in the gonads and adrenals have been described. These findings set the bases for a wide variety of future studies addressing the physiology and pathophysiology of human adrenal and gonadal development. We have minor comments: Title and text: We have concerns about the use of the phrase “genomic atlas” in this study. In fact, genomic atlases, e.g. cancer genome atlas, refer to the comprehensive description of variants of the genome, whereas this work makes a comprehensive description of the transcripts present in the three organs at different developmental stages. The phrases “transcriptomic atlas” or “atlas of gene expression” (as used on page 5) seem more adequate. Methods and Results: Carnegie and fetal stages are based on the morphological development of the embryo, and are not directly dependent on either age or size. This concept should be more clearly expressed (e.g. Supplementary Table 1 and text in Methods) in order to avoid that the non-specialised reader interpret that there are precise cut-offs (e.g. CS18=44-47.5 days, etc.). Methods and Results: Tissue transcriptome analysis by microarray is a powerful technique. Nonetheless, like other techniques based on RNA extraction from whole tissue, one limitation is the confounding effect due to modifications in RNA levels in single components whose relative proportion in the tissue varies or differs. For instance, STAR was 73-fold higher in the adrenal tissue probably because most of the tissue sample was composed of steroidogenic cells, whereas a similar amount of testis sample would only have a few Leydig cells. This does not mean that one cortical adrenal cell expresses more STAR than one Leydig cell. Or, if Sertoli cells represent 80% of testicular tissue on week 6 and 50% on week 10, microarray results from whole testicular tissue will show a lower expression level of a given Sertoli cell RNA even if each Sertoli cell expresses the same amount of the given RNA. This limitation should be considered in the interpretation of the results: up/down-regulation give the idea of regulated increase/decrease of a given RNA expression in one cell rather than increase/decrease of RNA levels in whole tissue, which could be due to the relative proportion of cells expressing that given RNA. Therefore, the words up-regulation and down-regulation may be misleading, and may need to be replaced (e.g. “more/less abundant in whole testicular/ovarian/adrenal tissue”). Methods: We do not have expertise to assess the BALT model used to pinpoint the time when gene expression levels change. A mathematician/statistician should be consulted. Results: We would have expected SRY and SOX9 to appear as a testis differentially expressed genes on Figure 2. Could the authors discuss why they did not select them for this figure?

As can be seen in Fig. 6b and 8a even changes within the tissue are subtle. Figure 6: A differential expression of SRY on the adrenal is unexpected. Could the authors comment on this?SRY may have some extra-gonadal expression, for example in the adrenal and brain. We mentioned the potential role of SRY in the regulation of renin in the discussion. This is an interesting area for future research. Suppl.

This a frequent finding in infertile patients. Could the authors discuss this finding?The inv(9)(p11q13) balanced translocation is quite a common finding in the general population (1.2-2.3%). Although data originally suggested this could be linked to infertility, more recent publications have shown that differences in 1800 infertile people were not statistically significantly higher (Association of pericentric inversion of chromosome 9 and infertility in romanian population. Dana M, Stoian V. Maedica (Buchar). 2012 Jan;7(1):25-9; see also Heteromorphic variants of chromosome 9. Kosyakova
et al. Molecular Cytogenetics 2013;6:14). Several studies are also biased as this change can increase with age and individuals being investigated for fertility were often older. There were no specific outlying effects of these samples in our analysis, so we felt comfortable including them in the dataset.

The development of both tissues is closely linked as they both derive from the same region of intermediate mesoderm in early embryogenesis. Given this shared history it is not surprising that they share many processes such as steroidogenesis in common. However, until the current study most of our understanding of spatial and temporal gene expression profiles in these tissues has come from mouse studies which are not always applicable to humans. This study by Achermann and colleagues finally addresses this fundamental gap in our knowledge. The authors extracted RNA from adrenal, testis, ovary and control tissues between 6-10 weeks
post coitum (wpc) in human embryos. The RNA was then subjected to an Affymetrix array and subsequent differential gene expression analysis and mathematical modelling to identify temporal changes across the dataset. In addition, they used pathway analysis and confirmed the cellular localization of novel genes using immunohistochemistry. The study confirmed the expression profiles of many known genes such as
NR5A1 and identified many potential novel genes. Interestingly, they showed that the only protein coding Y-chromosome gene detected in the developing human testis (CS18-CS22) was the
SRY gene. Twenty-five years since the discovery of
SRY as the sole primary testis determining factor we now have further proof in human tissue that this is the case. Novel components of the adrenal pathway have been identified as have genes that are potentially up-regulated by
SOX9 such as
CITED1,
ZNF280B and
PRPS2. In addition, potential novel genes were associated with adrenal and testicular steroidogenesis (eg.
FOXO4,
MAP3K15 and
RMND2). Of interest was the finding that while a similar number of differentially expressed genes were found in the testis and ovary, pathway-enrichment analysis failed to reveal any annotated pathways in the later. The study did reveal some interesting candidate ovarian genes such as
OR10G9 and
OR4D5, some of which appear to be involved in neurotransmission. This clearly highlights our lack of understanding of early ovarian development, and suggests that additional methods may be required to find novel genetic pathways important in this tissue. The public availability of this data will be a great future resource for any researchers interested in human adrenal or gonadal development. In addition, this database may allow researchers to isolate novel genes involved in gonadal and adrenal disorders, many of which currently lack a defined genetic aetiology. Finally, while the authors used a highly comprehensive set of tissues, expression analysis using microarray platforms can have several drawbacks compared to technologies such as RNA-Seq. Microarrays have been shown to have poorer sensitivity for lowly-abundant RNA compared to RNA-Seq and may also miss expression data for poorly annotated genes and alternative transcripts.

At this stage of development the cells at the boundary of the cords are not particularly flattened like classic peritubular myoid cells. Certainly the cells containing SCUBE1 are fairly round and in some cases staining is seen throughout the cytoplasm and in some more centrally positioned cells. As SCUBE1 is potentially a secreted protein we wondered if the peripheral localisation was to do with this. However, we take the reviewers point that these could be developing PTM cells. We have not been able to address this further at present but will do so if we explore the role of SCUBE1 in the future.

As previously reported in sSA a large fraction of tested samples (42%) were sero-positive for PARV4 with a statistically greater number of those also being HIV sero-positive rather than HIV sero-negative. Adults showed a greater rate of PARV4 antibody detection than children. No HCV RNA was detected and there was no correlation between PARV4 antibody detection and presence of HBsAg. This is a nicely performed study also showing that children are being infected by a still unknown route (4/5 PARV4 DNA positive samples were from children and children showed antibody positivity rate of 21%). The higher rate of PARV4 antibodies in HIV infected individuals is reminiscent of the situation in Europe/US where PARV4 infection focused in adults with HIV and/or HCV infections and heamophiliacs, presumably through injection drug use or other forms of blood and blood products contacts. The current studies also confirms the predominance of PARV4 genotype 3 in sSA while European and North American are mostly infected with genotypes 1 and 2. Whether PARV4 is acquired through the same routes as HIV seems likely although how children become infected remains unclear. Infection in children may occur through the usual routes for parvoviruses which includes both the respiratory track (human parvovirus B19) or the fecal oral route (canine parvovirus). Unlike the situation in adults the rate of PARV4 antibody detection in children was not higher in HIV positive children. No association was found between PARV4 antibodies and either CD4 counts and HIV viral load. The persistent high level of CD8 T cell response to PARV4 peptides seems to indicate the lingering presence of antigens despite low rate of detectable viremia (5/695). This is interpreted as reflecting occasional reactivation from latent reservoirs although replication below the level of detection in the still unknown cellular target of PARV4 could also account for the strong CD8 responses.   Last word abstract could replace “…clinical significance of this organism”. by “…clinical significance of this recently identified virus”. Page 6 it is mentioned that there is no relationship PARV4 antibodies with sex, cohorts, location, adult/child or HBsAg status. Isn’t the statement about adult/child contradicted by claim in second paragraph of results that adults have greater rates of PARV4 antibodies than children? In discussion insert reference about sero-prevalence being strikingly higher than in Western Europe. The following sentence could use more clarity: Overall, therefore, these data do not support the hypothesis that either vertical or blood-borne transmission is likely to be highly epidemiologically significant in driving the high PARV4 seroprevalence in sSA. Couldn’t the high rate of PARV4 IgG in children reflect at least in part vertical infection from infected mothers? Couldn’t blood borne infection account for the association with HIV infection acquired through injection drug use? Is the lack of association with HBsAg used to infer that PARV4 not transmitted through injection drug use? That paragraph could be expanded. Couldn’t PARV4 be transmitted by both the oral route in children and by blood contact in adults much like parvovirus B19? PARV4 is compared to CMV but could also be compared to parvovirus B19 whose DNA has been detected in skin tissues for years after infection.I have read this submission.

Interestingly, they have found that about half of cancer cell lines express at least one OR gene and most of them express only one specific receptor. Some OR genes are highly expressed across different tumor types whilst others are highly expressed in a single specific tumor type. OR2C3 in particular, which was not previously related to cancer, was found highly expressed in several melanoma cell lines but not in other cancer cell lines or in normal melanocytes. The data in the manuscript are convincing, substantiating and expanding the role of ORs as potential target or biomarkers in cancer. However several ORs, such as OR51E1, OR51E2 and OR2W3, which have been previously described to be upregulated in cancer tissues (1-5) do not emerge as highly expressed ORs in the analysis reported this manuscript. A discussion on different methodologies used in different studies and the utility of cell lines as tumor models would make the article scientifically sound.

The authors are to be commended for the breadth of their analysis. Suggestions for improvement are as follows:
The most obvious concern is the lack of independent validation of their analysis (e.g. qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization, IHC, etc.). A possible alternative would be to ask whether their analysis detects olfactory receptors previously shown to be expressed in certain cancer types. These include 51E2 (cited by the authors as an impetus for these studies), 2AT4 (leukemia), 51E1 (lung, gastric, neuroendocrine), OR2W3 (pancreatic), and others. All of these receptors were detected by the authors, but their expression patterns (Supplemental Table 1) do not always match published expression patterns. A discussion describing the sensitivity and/or limitations of their analysis would be helpful.The authors ignore the trace amino acid receptors (TAARs), which are also considered olfactory receptors. While the expression of family members outside of the olfactory epithelium is thought to be limited (with the exception of TAAR1), it would have been interesting to know if they detected any such expression in cancer cells. At a minimum, they should note why they excluded these receptors from their analysis. MS4As have also recently been implicated in odorant sensing, but given the recent nature of this discovery, it is not surprising that they were not included in this work.The authors assert that olfactory receptor expression in cancer has essentially been neglected in cancer research. This statement is in part in the eye of the beholder, however, multiple papers have been published recently showing functional analyses of olfactory receptor signaling on cancer progression. The authors should consider expanding their citations. Some of these studies are listed below.In the abstract, the authors state that ""recent"" reports indicate the presence of non-epithelial olfactory expression. But such expression is hardly recent, and has been known since the late 1990's, as I'm sure the authors are aware.

In vitro functional characterization revealed that some of these mutations had major impacts on NMDA receptor expression, biophysical and pharmacological properties (see, for example, Swanger et al. and Serraz et al.

5). However, although predicted to be “possibly damaging” by Endele et al.
1, the functional effect of the GluN2A
R586K mutation had never been investigated. Since R586 is located in the M1-M2 loop, close to the pore, they logically investigated the permeation and block properties of the GluN1/ GluN2A
R586K mutant and found that magnesium block, conductance and mean open times were unaffected in Xenopus oocytes and cultured neurons. They thus concluded that this mutation is probably benign. The manuscript is written well and the experiments are clearly described in the experimental section. I have however several reservations concerning the experimental work and some suggestions for the discussion, which I hope might improve the quality of the manuscript.  
Magnesium block: The authors only test the effect of one concentration (1mM), at one holding potential. Although 1mM magnesium is close to the physiological concentration, it seems that this concentration is saturating for GluN1/GluN2A receptors at -60 mV, which may hide differences in magnesium sensitivities between wt and R586K receptors. The authors should test different concentrations and different holding potentials to be able to conclude that magnesium block is unaffected by the mutation. Ideally, full current-voltage relationships should be measured at different magnesium concentrations.Pore opening properties: In their single channel experiments, the authors measure the single channel conductance and the mean open time. What about the open probability? Is it also unaffected by the mutation?Limiting the functional studies to the sole permeation and block properties of NMDARs is very restrictive. Although the mutation is located far from the extracellular domains, where most pharmacological agents act, it could very well affect the pharmacological properties of the receptor. For example, it has been shown that phosphorylation of residues located in the intracellular C-terminal tail could influence affinity for zinc, which binds in the extracellular N-terminal domain
6. Therefore, to conclude that the mutation has no clear functional effect, the authors should have measured the mutant sensitivity for the agonists glutamate (or NMDA) and glycine, its kinetics of activation and deactivation, as well as its sensitivity for the endogenous allosteric modulators zinc and protons.Relative to point #3, in the discussion section, where the authors state “The lack of functional consequences of the GluN2A
R586K variant”, they should say “The lack of consequences on the permeation and block properties of the GluN2A
R586K variant”. Indeed, the variant could have functional consequences that were not investigated in the study.In the discussion, the authors mention that “It is also possible that the variant affects other properties that have not been investigated in this study”. The authors should discuss in more details what properties could be affected by the variant (as previously mentioned, pharmacological properties, but also trafficking, downstream signaling…).Relative to points #3-5, the authors can certainly conclude that the mutation does not induce any dramatic effect on NMDAR function, which would show even at saturating agonist and magnesium concentrations. However, to conclude that it is “probably benign” would require further characterization of this variant.

1
,
2.  It is now also recognised that such rare coding variants may not necessarily have a functional impact. One such category of coding variant commonly known as Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS), are typically composed of missense mutations (amino acid substitutions) and are often carried in a heterozygous state. Whether such variants have a functional effect, and potentially could be pathogenic, depend on a number of factors including the mutated gene and gene product, genetic sequence context of the variant, and, where in the encoded protein the amino acid substitution occurs. However, certain families of genes have consistently been indicated to contain genetic variation associated with specific diseases. One such family of genes encode for glutamate neurotransmitter receptor subunits and have been associated with risk for developing a variety of brain diseases. The manuscript describes an
in vitro functional study of a missense variant within the NMDA type glutamate receptor subunit, GluN2A (gene
GRIN2A), which had originally been identified in the heterozygous state in an individual with epilepsy and/or abnormal EEG and reported by Endele et al., 2010. The variant was reported to be inherited and not arising
de novo, which is often considered to have a higher probability of being a pathogenic mutation. Mutations within
GRIN2A have previously been reported to cause a range of epilepsy syndromes consistent with an inherited autosomal dominant Mendelian manner
3
,
4 and also to contribute to risk for common complex neurodevelopmental diseases such as severe intellectual disability
5. The question of whether this VUS has a functional effect is indeed very pertinent. We find that the manuscript is written well with the aims and methods appropriately detailed. We have some comments regarding the experimental work and some suggestions for inclusion in the introduction and discussion sections, which we hope will contribute to the quality of the manuscript.Abstract The abstract needs to include the human gene name (
GRIN2A) and that rare variants have been identified within NMDA subunit genes in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders as well as in unaffected individuals.Introduction It would be useful to have more of an overview of how genetic variation within
GRIN2A is thought to contribute to brain disease, i.e. genotype-phenotype relationships (e.g. type of mutations, mode of inheritance, ‘causative’ for disease or associated with increased risk of disease). It should be stated in the introduction that
in silico tools had been used to predict the function consequence of this variant (as presented by Endele
et al., 2010,  supplementary Table 2) and that such prediction tools including others not used by Endele
et al., indicate that this variant is predicted to be consistently ‘possibly damaging’ as opposed to benign. This provides good justification to study the variant. It is also probably worth pointing out the severity of the amino acid substitution in the studied variant, i.e. it is a conservative change. Where discussing NMDARs as a “molecular coincidence detector”, it might be worth mentioning the requirement for glycine as co-agonist to glutamate too.Methods The methods were very well explained and are entirely repeatable.Results The first part of the results section shows the sensitivity of the NMDARs containing WT or mutated GluN2A to Mg
2+. The chosen concentration of Mg
2+ is indeed around the expected physiological concentration, but because it is more-or-less a saturating inhibitory concentration it would be harder to pick up any changes in sensitivity. Repeating the experiment with a lower concentration of Mg
2+ or better still obtaining an IC
50 would give more substance to the claim that this property is unchanged. The same is true for the experiments with transfected neurons where inhibition is very close to 100%. The methods section states that oocytes were clamped at several holding potentials but data is only shown for -60 mV. It would strengthen the claim that Mg
2+ sensitivity is unchanged if data for other holding potential is shown and/or discussed. Small changes to the voltage-dependence of inhibition could be responsible for defective physiological function of NMDARs. The responses of transfected neurons to NMDA in Fig. 2A-B may imply small alterations to desensitisation properties. Was there any measurable difference? In the single channel study, was there any difference in the mean closed time, and what was the outcome of the dwell time (open and closed) analysis mentioned in the methods?Discussion  In paragraph 2, more details are needed to explain why there may have been differences between the present findings and those previously reported for mutations found to have an impact on NMDA subunit properties. Indeed, with the breadth of type of mutations identified for different brain diseases and their mode of inheritance (loss of function, gain of function, het state) would you expect the same in terms of observable change of function? The authors state that this variant has been identified in two individuals out of 60,706 in the ExAC database and hence the authors suggest this provides additional evidence that this variant is not pathogenic and the occurrence in an individual with epilepsy was coincidental. However, the ExAC consortium includes genome data from individuals belonging to disease cohort studies as well as healthy ‘control’ individuals. All that is currently published about these two individuals who have this variant is that they do not have severe paediatric disease. It may be that these individuals belong to disease cohorts and have a diagnosis of a brain disease including neurodevelopmental disorders. It is quite possible that the genotype-phenotype relationship is not as straight forward as the original hypothesis, i.e. that this variant in isolation has a functional effect and that the effect on subunit properties is directly through an amino acid change. For example, several coding variants are thought to have an effect in tandem with other coding mutations (compound heterozygous mutations). Alternatively, other genomic/epigenetic mechanisms may be disrupted by this variant and underlie transcription and translation processes which affect subunit abundance.We have read this submission.

The method is based on a Bayesian hierarchical mixture of factor analyzers. The authors also discuss an extension of this method to deal with dropout events commonly observed in scRNA-seq datasets. Although they claim that the model obtained with this procedure is less misspecified, the computational requirements associated with it may be a burden, especially for very sparse gene expression matrices and unnecessary for practical purposes. MFA is evaluated on a synthetic dataset, scRNA-seq and mass cytometry data and compared with existing methods, although limited to Wishbone, Monocle2 and Diffusion Pseudotime. Overall, the manuscript is well written, the results clearly described and the source code provided. It may be helpful to consider/clarify the following points to improve the manuscript:
The computational requirements of MFA are not discussed in depth and running times are not reported. Please add a table comparing the execution times of the different methods tested using the full datasets presented and not the down-sampled versions. If a method fails to run in reasonable time, just report this fact (and if possible show the speed-up of MFA using down-sampled datasets). For different datasets, different values of (hyper)parameters are used but no clear guidelines are provided to the user in how to set those values. Please explain the rationale and if possible clear metrics that the users can use for tuning those parameters. “PCA is applied to the data before inference and the principal component that best corresponds to the trajectory based on the expression of known genes is used to initialize the pseudotimes”. Please explain how to initialize the pseudo-time in absence of known genes. I agree with Dr. Gitter about adding a short intro to factor analysis before jumping to equation 2. Please describe (or better show with a synthetic dataset) how MFA performs when more than one branching point is present. For example, using the synthetic dataset presented in Rizvi et al 2017 Nat Biotech (see Figure 2). The authors claim that explicitly modeling the dropout events doesn’t always justify the computational cost. I think it may be worth to test this idea on real datasets, especially droplet based (drop-seq, in-drop or 10x genomics) in which this problem is more pronounced. Good candidate datasets to show how the method performs in those settings are presented in van Dijk et al.
1 where their imputation strategy clearly improve pseudotime estimations or Zheng et al. 2016 Nat Comm. Application to scRNA-seq:  1) What is the running time without down-sampling? How comparable are the results with or without down-sampling? 2) Two genes (ELANE and CAR2) are presented to illustrate the bifurcation process, what other genes are significant by this analysis? It may be worth to show in a sup table the ranking obtained for each branch using MFA  (are
ELANE and CAR2 on top?). 3)
 “The comparison of the inferred pseudotimes with that MFA can be seen in Figure 4E. There is high correlations with PC2 (

” Please describe more explicitly how the correlation is calculated taking into account the fact that different approaches may have different number of branches (and that some genes may be relevant only in a sub-branch).Application to mass-cytometry data: 1) Please report the results and running time using the whole dataset.

MFA is a generative probabilistic model that uses factor analysis to model the expression properties of branches in a single-cell RNA-seq dataset.  A prior is used to encourage similar factor loading gradients in each branch.  An optional extension models the dropout phenomenon in which technical artifacts can cause non-zero mRNA abundances to be reported as zeros.  MFA is compared with several popular existing algorithms that are not generative probabilistic models: Wishbone, Diffusion Pseudotime, and Monocle 2.  These comparisons are conducted in a fair manner on simulated and real data.  The assessment of the benchmarking is balanced, as is the overall conclusion that in most cases MFA is competitive with these existing approaches even if there is not evidence that it definitively outperforms them by some quantitative metric. The balanced discussion is a strength of the manuscript overall.  Figures 2E and 3C both show the scenarios in which MFA's performance degrades with respect to dropout levels or the fraction of transient genes.  The authors conclude that in many practical analyses the extension for incorporating zero-inflation is not worth the added computational cost.  They also present the limitations of their linear model and offer suggestions for improving the scalability of the inference and the linearity assumption. The open source software is another asset and follows the best practices for scientific code.  The code is available in GitHub, and an archival version has been deposited in Zenodo.  The Zenodo version's title states that it is the ""Bioconductor-ready version"", and providing the mfa R package through Bioconductor would indeed further enhance its utility. Overall, the manuscript is easy to read, and the model is technically sound and well-motivated.  I have only minor comments that may improve the accessibility to a broader audience and help clarify some points. Minor comments: * The Methods section assumes that the reader is already familiar with factor analysis, as this technique is not explained.  It would be helpful to introduce the approach and the meaning of c and k in this biological context. * There has been other related work on branching trajectories in single-cell datasets.  A few examples include:

5 relates to MFA would help readers understand MFA's advantages and disadvantages.  I do not think it is necessary to benchmark against additional algorithms. * The parameter B, the number of branches, appears to be user-defined, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.  It would help users to offer guidance on selecting this crucial parameter. * The sensitivity to the hyperparameter values is not assessed.  It is not clear what model behavior was observed when modeling the mass cytometry dataset that led to the decision to use non-default values for alpha_x and beta_x and how users should make those decisions on new datasets. * I understand the mathematical invariance presented in Figure 1, but the biological argument is not intuitive.  In the bifurcation 2 -> 1,3 states 1 and 3 have the same expression level, which would suggest that this single gene does not exhibit branching behavior.  Rather, it switches from a high to low state in all cases. * The simulation with 300 bifurcating cells and 60 genes may have been too simple.  Even the first principal component of the data recovers the true pseudotimes well.  All of the methods perform extremely well, making it difficult to assess their relative performances. * I expected that the red cells along the lower curve in Figure 2B would be labeled as False in Figure 2C.  Visually, the branch point appears to occur around 15 on the PC1 axis. * Running Monocle 2 on a smaller set of sub-sampled cells than the other methods could put it at a disadvantage.  The scalability of MFA is not discussed or related to the runtimes of the other methods.  Could MFA run on the full mass cytometry dataset in a reasonable amount of time or is sub-sampling required? * There are a few potential typos:

NA,NA,Zipser,Barbara,NA,"Royal Holloway, University of London, UK",NA,"To all four referees:First of all many thanks for your input. I would like to address a few points from the reviews in a comment rather than in the main text body of my article.The question about the historical context of the transmission is a very good one, and MC already provided all there is to say in her review.The reason why I kept my discussion of the Palermo manuscript brief, and focused on the Theophanes passages in question is because a PhD student in Germany is working on this manuscript. We divided the topic between us so that there is not going to be any undue overlap.The “vernacular”:I use the word “vernacular” to describe the medieval, and to a certain extent also early modern, idiom (that was mostly) spoken in the Greek world. This term is generally understood in anglophone scholarship, but it is far from ideal for all the reasons outlined by the reviewers. However, until a more fitting term is found, I shall continue to use “vernacular”.We have only very few edited testimonies of texts that are solely written in the vernacular, but many more exist. Some more evidence can be extracted from other sources, such as for instance Leo medicus, as referenced in my article. The pronunciation of the vernacular is for instance described in Latin in some lemmata of Simon of Genoa's
Clavis Sanationis.There are indeed a number of major studies in the history of the Greek language. However, these studies all use different terminology to describe what I call the vernacular. Here are some samples:- R. Browning 1969.
Medieval and Modern Greek. Cambridge: CUP. On p. 55, he talks about informal, living speech and subliterary texts representing an uneasy balance between the purist ideal and the speech of the people.- G. Horrocks 1997.
Greek. A History of the Language and its Speakers. London: Longman. On p. 153-155 he talks about vernacular Greek.- F. Rodriguez Adrados 2005.
A History of the Greek Language. From its Origins to the Present. Leiden: Brill. On p. 245 he talks about popular texts.A good analysis can be found in: D. Holton, I. Manolessou, “Medieval and Early Modern Greek”, in E. Bakker (2005).
A Companion to the Ancient Greek Language, Chichester: Blackwell, p. 539-563. Many thanks to Petros Bouras-Vallianatos to pointing this out.The general debate about the nature of modern Greek is also ongoing, which is certainly going to have an influence on the discussion on the medieval vernacular.Altogether, it is quite clear that the question of diglossia in the Middle Ages cannot be resolved here, but perhaps the matters raised in the reviews might help further the discussion.The “mainstream” version:I use the word “mainstream” to describe the most frequently transmitted version of a medical text.The odd παρά and the syntax of the versions:I have thought about this a lot, when I wrote the article, and then again when I read the review, and I came to the conclusion that I shall leave it as it stands, and also in particular as we would need a better understanding of the medieval grammar and lexicon to resolve this.The syntax has indeed been simplified in the versions.The colour κίτρινον
kitrinon:It is notoriously difficult to identify colours in ancient or medieval texts. This is in particular the case as only very few sources have even been edited. Surprisingly, a TLG search did indeed yield one good source. It is transmitted in the Par. gr. 2329 f. 184v, a 17
th century manuscript (starts from line 3 of the second paragraph).
http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10722308m/f189.item The language of the text could very well be consistent with an earlier, medieval date.Καὶ κρόκον βάλε καὶ κορκουμὰν, καὶ μέλι, καὶ ἄλλα κίτρινα· νόει κρόκους ὠῶν καὶ χολὴν βοὸς κιτρίνου ξηράν. - And add saffron and turmeric and honey and other things that are
kitrina. Consider egg yolk and the dry bile of a
kitrinou bull.This recipe is mentioned in connection with a procedure to make a metal appear like gold, and it is fairly clear that the colour the author had in mind was yellow.Citron or lemon:These modern English words designate two distinct types of fruit. However, it would be problematic to assume that these two words consistently described two distinct types of fruit in Classical and Medieval Greek as well. Citrons and lemons look very similar indeed, and it is certainly possible that these names were not used consistently. This would also be supported by the fact that the word for lemon is derived from the Greek word for citron in at least two different European language that immediately come to my mind, German and Polish.We would need to gather more Greek textual evidence to address this question. What is currently available on the TLG does not suffice, and the situation may be complicated by regional dialects as well.But perhaps it is worth pointing out that both words are relatively rarely attested on the TLG, which in turn raises a lot of questions.Theological texts:For some reason, theological scholarship does not have a problem with texts that were augmented later on, for instance
catenae. For this reason, I adopted some editorial methods from the Nestle Aland edition of the New Testament for my edition of Ioannes archiatrus.",11,4,2017,2017-4-11,PMC5384629,Research Article,28393114,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.9991.2,Revisions of Theophanes Chrysobalantes De Curatione.,2017-03-13,research-article; journal article; 
Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.10767.r20944,Wilkins,John,NA,"1Classics and Ancient History, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK",approve,"This is a valuable and well researched article of a proper scientific standard. Title, abstract and structure are fine. Conclusions are well drawn. It concerns the history of medicine in the Byzantine period, a rich but seriously under-researched period, apart from the history of manuscripts, which is the topic of the article. The article shows that the scribes in certain parts of the tradition were modifying the text and simplifying it for their own purposes, in contrast with the accurate reproduction of the text in the scholarly branch of the tradition. This process is to be expected in Byzantium and throughout the other cultures - Syrian, Arabic, Hebrew and Western European - which adopted the Greek medical corpus. Minor suggestions I would have for the author are: Check the use of
kitrinon in texts of the period. The citron is the citrus plant most likely to be familiar in Byzantium, more so than in texts in the time of Theophrastus or Galen. Its taste and flavours are not lemony any more than an apple tastes like a pear, nor is the colour lemon-yellow. I think it is more green-yellow and quite different from standard yellow words in Greek. In the first extract, the author might add, by way of explaining the simplification of the text, that a clause has replaced a genitive absolute. Is it a grammatical simplification as well as a muddled scientific modification? I very much like the conclusion that the scribes were medically literate and had a scientific interest in where or not a 'doctor' was needed, whether or not 'bad humour' was the medical term that was appropriate, and whether or not a Galenic 'cause' should be inserted into the text. These findings need to filter through to the medical and social history of Byzantium.I have read this submission.

De curatione. It is an important piece of work not only for the useful insights it offers into the different versions of the mainstream text but mostly for its observations on the working methods of different editors, their intellectual background and intended audiences. It will hopefully (re)emphasise the need for similar research which must be conducted in this significant area of study focusing on the circulation and reception of Byzantine medical works. The article is suitable for publication in its current form. Some suggestions are provided below, which the author may want to consider and/or address:
Page 2, paragraph 2: I think it might be worth clarifying how the term “mainstream” is used throughout. Does this refer to the most widely circulated version of the text?Page 2, paragraph 2: is
De curatione a therapeutic manual only, or important for its value as a diagnostic manual as well?Page 2, paragraph 3: What are the exact folio numbers preserving Theophanes’ text in the Palermo manuscript?Page 2, note 3: Constantine Porphyrogenitus’ name needs to be referred to consistently (compared to its occurrence in notes 27 and 28). Also, it is worth consulting and citing the useful article by Joseph A. M. Sonderkamp (1984)
1, who provides a lengthy discussion on the addressee of Theophanes’ work.  Page 2, note 3: Is Bernard’s edition the only available edition of the text? If not, it would be worthwhile to refer to earlier[?] editions.Page 2, “Transcription of the mainstream text”: Why “transcription”? It is stated above that the mainstream text is printed in line with Bernard’s edition. So why not just say “edition of the mainstream text”? Furthermore, it would be helpful to provide references to page number and lines in Bernard’s edition for all the passages commented upon in the article.Page 2, passage 4 On pityriasis: Since the name of diseases (here and below) are transliterated, they should be given in italics for the reader’s convenience.Page 2, passage 4 “It happens when bad humours are brought up around the head”: παρά + accusative denotes movement towards a person or a thing, so maybe “to”/“into” the head (see Demetrakos s.v. παρά, 12 and LSJ s.v. παρά C.I.1).Page 2, passage 4, “…cleaning of the superfluous humour”: Better: “evacuation”Page 2-3, passage 8: The translation for “Εἰ μὲν ... καθαίρομεν” is missing.Page 3, passage 8, “the hair of the head falls out”: maybe “the hair falls out from the head”Page 2, passage 8, “and first remove it”: perhaps “and the first thing you should do is to purge it”Page 2, passage 8, “the aloe- and bitter”: rather “by means of aloe and bitter...” in line with “διὰ τῆς ἱερᾶς ἀντιδότου” of the previous sentence.Page 3, Transcription of the Florence/Wellcome group, passage 4 “on the other white and bran like skin of the flesh”: “on the rest of the skin of the white and bran-like flesh”Page 3, Transcription of the Florence/Wellcome group, passage 4 “…or from salty phlegm…” : “…consisting either of salty phlegm …”Page 3, note 7: it is worth mentioning that the Wellcome manuscript is not listed in Sonderkamp’s sigla.Page 6: How do you define the term “vernacular”? Any relevant literature? See, for example, Robert Browning (1983)

De curatione? Please consider adding some further examples.

It takes as an example a treatise composed in Byzantium in the 10th century by a certain Theophanes Chrysobalantes, the
Epitome de curatione morborum. Its approach is relevant. It takes two concrete examples, namely two chapters devoted respectively to the diseases
pityriasis and
alopecia, and compares their text as given by the reference edition (published at the end of the 18th century) and by three different revised versions, which B. Zipser identified. She shows that in these three versions, the text has been rewritten - on the one hand to adapt it to the linguistic evolutions of Greek language, and on the other hand to become easier to understand. The analysis is well conducted and well argued. The results are convincing. However, I have some remarks, which do not detract from the value of the conclusions but aim to make the article more precise:
Concerning the question of the evolution of Greek language in the Byzantine period and the birth of the so-called ""vernacular"" Greek, there must exist a bibliography in the domain of linguistics. I do not know it personally (being not at all competent in linguistics), but I presume it would be useful, in order to ensure the credibility of this argument, to mention some basic publications in this field. I can not conceive that no one has ever studied the evolution of Greek language in medieval time.Concerning the dating of the revised versions and the conclusions of the article, it seems to me that the three revisions discussed here should be clearly distinguished. Generally, moreover, it would be interesting to provide the readers with some context on the manuscripts that contain these versions. This would help to find some data to answer to the important question asked by B. Zipser: ""[...] one is left wondering who the intended audience of these versions was."" Even without depth research, one can get information by taking into account the basic bibliography of the manuscripts. For example : - The ms. Escorial T.III.1 was copied towards the middle of the 16th century by Iakobos Diassorinos (as indicated in Revilla's catalog, see detailed remarks below). Given the biography of the copyist, it is probable that this took place in Western Europe; there may be information about this in the Masters thesis of P. García Bueno, 
Los manuscritos griegos de El Escorial copiados por Jacobo Diasorino: estudio paleográfico y codicológico, Madrid, Univ. Complutense, 2011 (which I have not read)
1
 Now, Diassorinos is well known as a forger of texts; also, he was quite interested in medicine. There is therefore a good chance that the revised version transmitted by the Escorial manuscript would be from Diassorinos himself. We can at least ask the question, especially as we do not find this version in any previous manuscript. - The Palermo manuscript comes from Crete, where it was realized in the first half of the 16th century, probably around 1525 (as said in the manuscript description of ManusOnline, cited by B. Zipser). This manuscript is a huge medical compendium (more than 1000 folios!), gathering material from many different sources. No other manuscript resembles it. Could we make the hypothesis that it was its own copyists who did the editing work? We can at least ask the question, since these men already seem to have accomplished a sort of editorial work, by gathering scattered information. - As for the Florence manuscript, it was copied towards the beginning of the second half of the 14th century in Constantinople (one of its copyists was identified as Crateros, one of the collaborators of the great scholar Nicephorus Gregoras - see D. Bianconi, 2008
2, mentioned in the bibliography of the Biblioteca Laurenziana website). The London manuscript MSL 135, which contains a version very similar to that of the Florence manuscript, was copied in the East, in the middle of the 16th century (as indicated in the catalogue of P. Bouras -Vallianatos, mentioned by B. Zipser). Except if it descends from the Florence manuscript (a fact which must be stated clearly), it must go back to a common model. This common model, which must have been prior to the second half of the 14th century, was therefore still in the Orient towards the middle of the 16th century. The London manuscript therefore confirms that the revision it preserves, together with the Florence manuscript, goes back to the middle of the 14th century at the latest, and that it circulated in Constantinople and its region, where it may have been made. One could make this hypothesis for the origin of this revised version even if, actually, nothing proves it. There are therefore three versions which clearly differ from each other, both in a geographical and chronological point of view (Western Europe in mid-16th century; Crete in the first half of the 16th century; Constantinople and its region in the middle of the 14th century). The article would benefit from distinguishing them.   These remarks are only suggestions for further researches; they do not call into question the quality of the article. Remarks concerning details:
The first mention of the Escorial ms.: one could add the Library’s name : Escorial,
Real Bibioteca, Τ III 1.Note 5: There exists a more recent catalogue : Revilla, Alejo (O.S.A.),

The first mention of the Palermo ms.: add the end folios of the text (as indicated in the online catalogue mentioned at note 8): f.121r
-238v (unless this indication is erroneous).“The manuscripts from Florence and the Wellcome Library present a near identical text, and are therefore siblings”: one could imagine that the Wellcome ms. may be a copy of the Florence ms. Is this impossible?Note 6: it could be useful to add the link to the digitized images:

It could be just a sort of linguistic update. So B. Zipser is right in presuming no special relation between the Florence/Wellcome version and the Ro1 ms.Paragraph beginning with “The final manuscript [...]”: Are Theophanes’
Therapeutics the same book as
De curatione?Note 29: the reader would appreciate a few more explanations (namely that Leo explicitly quotes a “vernacular” word?). One can not understand this without having a look at Leo’s text.Last phrase: “Their attitude towards an author such as Theophanes was very different from the attitude of ordinary scribes who aimed to preserve the works of earlier authorities as accurately as possible”: this is not entirely true for all texts. While sacred texts and, in general, texts from famous and most known authors were (mostly) transcribed with respect, it is obvious that scientific and technical texts, above all those attributed to little known authors (to tell nothing about anonymous texts), were much more subject to changes and rewordings. Alas, Theophanes is not the only medical author in this case.

Although the article's conclusions are drawn on the basis of a specific text and its versions in concrete manuscripts (as is appropriate), they can be applied more broadly to the manuscript transmission of other medical (and more broadly technical) texts. The article is acceptable as is,  but would gain in interest and depth if the author could add some discussion on the following:
In the four manuscripts under examination, what other texts is Theophanes Chrysobalantos copied with? Do these other texts present characteristics similar to the revised versions of Theophanes Chrysobalantos? In other words, can these manuscripts as integral objects (and not as vehicles for single texts) be construed as professional manuals for practitioners with a particular profile, perhaps reflected in the register at which most of the texts they contain is pitched?In the Escorial manuscript, could the specification that a doctor has to empty the superfluous humor etc, help us understand anything at all about a possible division of labor between doctors and medical assistants? Of course, this one mention of a doctor is not enough. The manuscript could, perhaps, be scrutinized for more clues (which it may or may not contain).What can physical characteristics of the codices (e.g. one or many hands, types of paper, date and type of binding, possessor's notes, etc), tell us about the post-Byzantine reception of Byzantine medicine (especially given that three of the four are sixteenth-century manuscripts)? Do these sixteenth-century manuscripts appear to have been created within an Ottoman or early modern European context? What does this tell us about the role of Byzantine medicine in early Ottoman or early modern European practice? Inquiry in the above three directions may allow a more detailed sociology of the redactors, scribes, and users of Theophanes' text.  An issue that does not affect the argument and overall scholarly contribution of the article, but one that the author may wish to address if she chooses to introduce revisions is the following: the article's current discussion of what a vernacular register is and when it is introduced into writing is somewhat old fashioned (predicated on aligning developments in Greek with developments in other European languages and the rise of the European ""vernaculars""). All languages with long written traditions have multiple written registers (closer or more remote from the high brow canon). When vernacularisms become manifest in written literature largely depends on how long the surviving written record is. Vernacularisms in written Greek are evident since the translations collectively known as the Septuagint, the compilation of the Christian gospels (canonical and apocryphal), the publication of the acts of the church councils, or the composition of best sellers of monastic literature, such as the Spiritual Meadow by John Moschos—in other words, considerably earlier than the tenth century. Given that the earliest surviving Greek medical manuscripts are from the tenth century (e.g. Paul of Aegina now in Paris) and that, in their overwhelming majority, date from the twelfth century and later, our ability to discern vernacularisms in the medical texts earlier than these dates is limited. But this does not mean that a linguistic vernacularization of medical texts was not part of earlier medical practice and training.I have read this submission.

However, I have picked up one issue around the way the results are interpreted and need for further verification of the results. I would like therefore, to raise the following concern (point (i) below), and some additional comments (points (ii) to (iv) below) for improvement:One would expect that once the first indications of the
East
-kdr alleles were observed; and given that this was a single specimen which was heterozygous, the researchers should have conducted an expanded survey in the study area to try and confirm presence of this mutation on the vector populations. Having said that, the fact that
East
-kdr mutations have already been observed in other West African countries outside the Cote d’Ivoire, one might argue that it was only a matter of time before it is observed in this current location. Nevertheless, as it stands, this first report is made based on a single specimen, without any additional verification. I assume that the authors intend to conduct such verification and present additional data, possibly in a follow up publication.The labelling and caption for Figure 1 can be confusing for some readers. It requires greater clarity. For example, the use of the term “susceptible” in this figure does not appear mean the same thing as the term “susceptible” as used when describing results of the WHO susceptibility assays.Third (discussion section), in addition to the observations of
East-
kdr, another significant finding here is the extremely low mortality observed among mosquitoes exposed to pyrethroids (1% with deltamethrin), carbamates (38% with bendiocarb) and organochlorides (0% with DDT). These high resistance levels may seem obvious and commonplace in West Africa, but they do warrant greater discussion, with relevance to current vector control tools. A comment of any results of previous intensity assays done in the area would be useful in this context.Lastly, the authors state in the discussion that “
According to WHO, with the current level of vector control coverage, about 220,000 children below 5 years are saved each year; if pyrethroids were to lose their effectiveness due to resistances, this number could decrease significantly”. Well, given the results from this specific study and also a number of other studies from the region, the pyrethroids have already clearly lost their efficacy against mosquitoes. So perhaps an important question is whether and how this change is in any way associated with the overall effectiveness of current interventions. The authors make a case for further surveillance to monitor east-KDR prevalence in the area. The current report is based on a single specimen, so such additional surveys, including some focus on confirming presence of east-KDR are warranted.Data (if applicable):  Enough information has been provided to be able to replicate the experiment. The data is in a usable format/structure and all the data has been provided.I have read this submission.

Therefore everybody with appropriate scientific background could replicate the experiment.Discussion and conclusion:  According to me the conclusions are sensible, but not totally balanced and justified on the basis of the results of the study. In my opinion, the detection of East-kdr in Ivory coast where it has not been reported yet is a proof that resistance genes are spraying across the continent. However, by saying that ""
The alarming new occurrence of this mutation in Ivorian anopheles mosquito populations represents a major threat to on-going vector control activities as the current strategy of the National Malaria Control Program in the country is heavily based on the use of long lasting nets"", one could understand or assume that the East-Kdr mutation confers greater resistance than the West-kdr mutation which is already widespread in Ivory Coast. Therefore by identifying this mutation in this country, the level of resistance in
Anopheles population would increase. Is this the case? According to some authors (eg: Reimer et al. 2008) the West-kdr seems to confer greater resistance than the East-kdr. Therefore, I suggest the authors of this paper to add in the discussion information about the real impact of the presence of East-kdr or both mutations, on level of resistance of local malaria vector populations.I have read this submission.

For two of the sample sets, parasites were collected at different time points, allowing identification of population changes over time and space. Overall, the analysis was sound and results were well explained. The authors also notified the limitations of the study. For example, inclusion of additional parasite samples between these western and eastern sites, and use of more SNP markers would validate whether the conclusions drawn here represent the whole African continent. Comments:
The assumption for comparing the temporally collected samples is that malaria case numbers have been reduced, which might lead to genetic isolation and structuring of parasite populations. It would be great if malaria epidemiology at the beginning and end of sample collection in the sites where samples were collected is clearly stated. It is possible that despite the overall reduction in malaria cases, some of the sites may represent hotspots where malaria epidemiology remained more or less unchanged over the time. As a result, this would make the parasite populations and genetics relatively stable over the time.The inclusion of numerous SNPs for this type of analysis is a nice practice. However, the authors may want to separate those that are clearly under selection (such as EBA175 and AMA1), since these mutations are subject to strong immune selection and will have different evolutionary trajectories as compared to more neutral SNPs. More detailed comparison of the two Kenyan sites might be interesting to see whether gene flow between these sites exists, given that these sites are relatively closely located, yet separated by potential gene flow barriers (such as the rift valley).

As a result, this would make the parasite populations and genetics relatively stable over the time.The following statement has been added to show the changing epidemiology of malaria during the study period:“Over the study period, malaria transmission, as measured by malaria slide positivity rate, fell from 56% in 1998 to 7% in 2009 in Kilifi
1, and rose slightly in Fajara and Brikama in the Gambia
2.”There was no data showing temporal variation in malaria transmission in Rachuonyo South because the samples were collected in a single cross-sectional survey.The inclusion of numerous SNPs for this type of analysis is a nice practice. However, the authors may want to separate those that are clearly under selection (such as EBA175 and AMA1), since these mutations are subject to strong immune selection and will have different evolutionary trajectories as compared to more neutral SNPs. We have included the following additional text to show the number of SNPs typed in EBA175 and AMA1:“Separate analyses were also carried out for subsets of SNPs typed in EBA 175 (39, 36 and 20 SNPs in The Gambia, Kilifi and Rachuonyo South, respectively) and AMA1 (9 SNPs in The Gambia and 8 SNPs in Kilifi). Only 3 SNPs were genotyped in Rachuonyo South, so this SNP subset was not analysed separately.” And expounded on the section describing the outcome of these analyses: “In all study sites, separate analyses of EBA175 and AMA1 did not reveal qualitatively different results from the pooled analyses (supplementary figures 1- 3) and only the results of the pooled analyses are presented here.”More detailed comparison of the two Kenyan sites might be interesting to see whether gene flow between these sites exists, given that these sites are relatively closely located, yet separated by potential gene flow barriers (such as the rift valley).The current study focused on parasite movement and mixing within small, geographically-defined areas, and hence concentrated on analysing parasite genetics within individual sites. Furthermore, we did not have sufficient number of SNPs typed in these two populations to carry out a meaningful comparison. That said, your comment is important, and has been noted as a recommendation for future work, in the statement below:“Furthermore, as transmission continues to decline and malaria programmes gradually shift their focus from control to elimination, the analysis of parasite gene flow between different transmission foci, e.g. Kilifi and Rachuonyo South will become increasingly important in informing the mitigation measures needed to prevent importation of parasites as a result of human movement and migration. These analyses were not carried out in the current study since the numbers of common SNPs between the two Kenyan sites was low, and we only had parasites from one timepoint in Rachuonyo South, hence we were unable to conduct an informative analysis of gene flow between sites”",29,8,2017,2017-8-29,PMC5445974,Research Article,28612053,NA,Micro-epidemiological structuring of Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations in regions with varying transmission intensities in Africa.,2017-02-14,research-article; journal article;

There are various software that may help on this matter, i.e. Migrate-n.Migrate-n is a useful software for measuring migration rates between populations and is definitely useful for measuring gene flow within and between the different sites. It however, seems to need the parasites to be divided into populations and then to test for migration between these populations. Our current analyses aimed to step away from this requirement of specifying the populations a prior, and instead try to identify population structure based on clusters of genetically related parasites. The software also additionally requires the use of allele frequencies, while the current analyses focused on individual level genetic data. However, since such analyses may still be useful for identifying migration rates once distinct parasite populations have been identified, the following statement has been added in the discussion section. “Finally, we used genetic data to show that there is high parasite movement and mixing within individual study sites. Additional analyses using gene flow models, e.g. as implemented in Migrate-N software, can be used to further validate our hypothesis of rapid gene flow and to confirm whether the parasites are part of a panmictic population or whether there exists underlying population structure, as well as to determine directionality of parasite movement between different populations, assuming that such populations can be identified within the region.”This paragraph is not fully justified on basis of the results: “following mass-treatment campaigns we would predict that if residual foci of transmission are retained this will rapidly lead to reinfection of the wider community, and that parasites acquiring mutations conferring drug resistance or immunological escape will be rapidly spread at a micro-epidemiological level.”The statement has been re-written as follows to clarify the message: “On the other hand, based on the high level of parasite mixing observed at each study site, we would predict that ineffective application of control interventions such as mass drug administration that result in residual foci of transmission would lead to rapid re-infection of the wider community, and also that parasites acquiring mutations conferring drug resistance or immunological escape would spread rapidly at the micro-epidemiological level.

Specific comments: Abstract:
Please state how many samples and SNP markers were included in the final analysis.I wonder whether “relatedness in space and time” is the correct term, or “distance in space and time” would be more appropriate.   Results:
In the part on “Identification of geographical barriers to parasite movement” it would be useful to include the range of prevalence or MPF per pixel analyzed. The second paragraph of this part is difficult to follow, as the term ‘cluster’ is used consistently, without further indication on what the clusters represent. It would help to include a sentence describing that spatial clusters were analyzed based on the PCA values of all isolates found within the cluster. Thus, clusters of isolates differing from all other isolates were identified. The same is the case in the discussion. What sizes were the clusters identified, and how many haplotypes were included per cluster?Figure 5: Given that for almost every pair of samples the number of days differs, how were the days for the different curves calculated? I assume each color represents a range, yet only a point estimate is given. Also, please indicate in brackets for each curve the number of samples included. For example, how many samples were available for the 1-day and 31-days analysis in The Gambia? Could the apparent reduction in SNP difference at 10 km be a chance finding due to limited sample size? Including the number of SNPs analyzed in each population would further help to interpret the data. E.g. it is interesting that in Rachuonyo South the proportion of different SNPs is approx. twice as high as in the other sites, yet this is only evident when Figure 5 is compared to Table 1. Would it be possible to include confidence intervals for the 1-day curves in the figure? This would help to understand the power of the data. For example, the statement in the abstract “Genetic relatedness of sample pairs is predicted by relatedness in space and time” suggests that genetic relatedness can be inferred, once the distance by space and time is known. This is however difficult to assess without more detail on the variance of the data.In Table 2, what is the unit of the results showed? I assume it is SNP-difference/day (or SNP-difference/km), with days and distance log-transformed. Please state if/how data was transformed.   Discussion:
Paragraph 3 of the discussion could be expanded. At what spatial scales was population structure found in previous studies (as compared to the approx. 50 km range of the present study)? Have any of these studies included relatedness? This information would help to assess the feasibility to identify foci of higher transmission, and to estimate the level of gene flow to surrounding areas in different transmission settings.The number of SNP differences plateaus at approx. 1 km in The Gambia, 3 km in Kilifi, and increases up to 10 km in Rachuonyo South. Are there possible explanations for these differences due to the characteristics of the local parasite populations?

The interquartile range of both measures at each pixel size has also been added. “The range of MPF and parasite prevalence per pixel varied depending on the size of the pixels analysed. In the Kilifi population, MPF ranged from 0 – 100% (interquartile range (IQR) = 20%) for the 0.5km pixels; 0 – 100% (IQR = 14%) for the 1.0km pixels; 20 – 83% (IQR = 7%) for the 2km pixels; and 33 – 63% (IQR = 4.7%) for the 4km pixels. In the Rachuonyo South population, PCR positive prevalence varied from 0 – 75% (IQR = 19.4%) for the 0.5km pixels; 0 – 47% (IQR = 17.4%) for the 1.0km pixels; 3.5 – 35.8% (IQR = 14.3%) for the 2km pixels; and 6.2 – 33.4% (IQR = 7.8%) for the 4km pixels.”The second paragraph under ‘spatial autocorrelation’ heading in the methods section has been expanded to indicate what clusters represent and how they are identified, and now reads as follows:“Spatial scan statistics were calculated using SaTScan software and were run separately for each study site. The statistics involved running a purely spatial, retrospective analysis based on a normal probability distribution model using continuous variables (PC scores) and looking for areas with clusters of high PC scores. Latitude and longitude coordinates were used to represent the geographical locations of specific parasites, whereas principal component scores were used to represent individual parasite genotypes. During the analysis, a scanning window that gradually varies in size from including only a single homestead up to 50% of the population moves over the geographical space and at each window size and location, the ratio of parasites with high PCs inside the window versus outside the window is calculated. The window with the highest ratio is noted down as a cluster and its statistical significance is determined after accounting for multiple comparisons using random permutations.”The number of samples contained in each significant cluster has been added in the results section and now reads as follows:“In Kilifi, one cluster with a radius of 1.54 km (p=0.01) containing 15 parasites was detected, while in Rachuonyo South, a smaller cluster of genetically distinct parasites was detected with a radius of 0.5 km (p=0.001) containing 14 parasites”.And the following section has been added in the discussion section to make it clear that the clusters were based on PC scores:“However, using scan statistics we identified only two specific clusters of distinct parasite sub-populations based on PC scores, one in Kilifi and another in Rachuonyo South.”Figure 5: Given that for almost every pair of samples the number of days differs, how were the days for the different curves calculated? I assume each color represents a range, yet only a point estimate is given.The following statement has been added in the results section to show how the graphs were generated: “Since the number of days differed for almost all parasite pairs, dummy data were included in the regression analysis to enable the generation of time-distance interaction graphs. For each study site, a distance range of 1 – 10km (with an interval of 0.1km between adjacent distances) was used. Temporal distance with 14 and 10 day intervals were assigned to parasite pairs in Kilifi and the Gambia, respectively, whereas time was not considered for the Rachuonyo South population. Constant SNP differences of 14, 10 and 8 were used for parasite pairs in Kilifi, Rachuonyo South and the Gambia, respectively.”Also, please indicate in brackets for each curve the number of samples included. For example, how many samples were available for the 1-day and 31-days analysis in The Gambia? Could the apparent reduction in SNP difference at 10 km be a chance finding due to limited sample size?The number of samples used to draw each curve has been noted in the Figure legend. We agree with the reviewer that the decrease past 10km is likely due to limited sample size and is there probably not significant.Including the number of SNPs analyzed in each population would further help to interpret the data. E.g. it is interesting that in Rachuonyo South the proportion of different SNPs is approx. twice as high as in the other sites, yet this is only evident when Figure 5 is compared to Table 1.The number of SNPs analysed in each population has been added to the figure legend.Would it be possible to include confidence intervals for the 1-day curves in the figure?

In Table 2, what is the unit of the results showed? I assume it is SNP-difference/day (or SNP-difference/km), with days and distance log-transformed. Please state if/how data was transformed.The following statement has been added to Table 2 to show the units of measurement of the results.“Values represent the change in the number of SNP differences between parasite pairs per day (time), per kilometre (distance) and per day/kilometre (time-distance interaction). Time, distance and the product of time and distance (time-distance interaction) were log transformed prior to running the regression analyses.”Discussion:Paragraph 3 of the discussion could be expanded. At what spatial scales was population structure found in previous studies (as compared to the approx. 50 km range of the present study)? Have any of these studies included relatedness? This information would help to assess the feasibility to identify foci of higher transmission, and to estimate the level of gene flow to surrounding areas in different transmission settings.The paragraph has been expanded and now reads as follows:“Lack of genetic structuring of parasite populations observed in this study is indicative of a population that is well mixed. This observation of a highly mixing parasite population is in agreement with results of similar studies of parasite genetic diversity and population differentiation using microsatellites

56, 57 and SNPs
58 . These studies were carried out in parasite populations from different geographical regions representing a diverse range of transmission intensities from highest in Africa and oceania, intermediate in Southeast Asia, and lowest in south America. However, other studies have shown population structure when looking at the same population
48, 59– 61 , although these analyses were carried out on larger geographical scales than those analysed here and mostly involved analyses at provincial, country or continental levels. Population structure was most evident in regions with low transmissiion intensities such as south America or southeast Asia, and less evident in Africa where transmission intensity is much higher.”The number of SNP differences plateaus at approx. 1 km in The Gambia, 3 km in Kilifi, and increases up to 10 km in Rachuonyo South. Are there possible explanations for these differences due to the characteristics of the local parasite populations?Although the exact reason for the plateau observed is currently unknown, the following statement has been added to postulate possible reasons for the observation:“The number of SNP differences were seen to plateau at approximately 1km in the Gambia, 3km in Kilifi and 10km in Rachuonyo South. This may be attributed to the characteristics of the local parasite population, which in turn may be explained by the distribution of human settlement in the areas sampled, for example in the Gambia, homesteads tend to be clustered together in distinct, autonomous villages whereas in Rachuonyo South there is a denser and more uniform pattern of human settlement over the study area, enabling the interaction of parasites over a much larger distance.”",29,8,2017,2017-8-29,PMC5445974,Research Article,28612053,NA,Micro-epidemiological structuring of Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations in regions with varying transmission intensities in Africa.,2017-02-14,research-article; journal article;

How can heterozygous genotypes be detected in haploid populations of the parasite?As noted by the authors themselves, using 276 SNPs is rather limited. Genetic studies dealing with human populations at nowadays routinely rely on 500000 SNPs or more. One main feature of such studies is that microgeographical structures are deteted mostly from low frequency variants and rare variants, which of course are undetectable when using a limited set of markers. Moreover, these low frequency and rare variants are supposed to be highly relevant for phenotypic expression, in particular disease susceptibility and are largely responsible for recent and localized evolution in human populations. (see for example Leslie et al. (2015)

Some comments for further improvements: 
""explored"" in the Abstract is in past tense while the first verb (""review"") is in present tense. Chose either. In the ""Background"" section it is stated that ""Most vaccination coverage estimates in LMICs are from administrative reports that tend to overestimate coverage, due to errors in the number of vaccine doses administered and/or invalid assumptions about the size of the target population of children."" This statement should by preference be supported by a reference. I would say that most
estimates are based on surveys while vaccine coverage 
reports may be based on administrative reports, i.e. data from routine reporting in the health system.Under ""Methods"" the risk factors considered are listed. However, the factors listed should rather be called ""determinants"". For instance, maternal education is not a risk factor in itself but a determinant. Low maternal education carries a risk for  lower participation in vaccine programmes. The opposite goes for high education.As pointed out by other referees, it is questionable if ""possession of vaccine card"" can be put in the logistic regression model if outcome (children vaccinated) is measured with vaccine card. Clearly, there is a risk that possession of vaccine card increases your chance of being included in the sample.Under ""Ethic statement"" it is said that ""...written informed consent is obtained from each survey participant"" and a reference to DHS is given. I would soften this fact and make it clearer that it is coming from the DHS report. It could for instance be formulated ""The DHS programme reports that...."".There are two ""after"" after each other in the sentence following the one quoted under (5).On page 7 in the second paragraph in the section titled ""Predictors of complete vaccination status"" the term risk factor is again used in an inaccurate way, I believe. A ""risk factor"" is related to a negative outcome (in order for it to be a ""risk""). Hence, there cannot be ""risk factors for complete vaccination"". They should be called ""determinants"" of ""predictors"".The article is based on an analysis between countries under the standard assumption that countries form relatively coherent entities suitable for comparison. However, intra-country variation may be as important as inter-country variation when it comes to primary care services. Hard to reach regions may be more or less represented in the countries compared. It would be useful if the authors could comment on this somewhere in the article, preferably in the discussion section.Under ""Discussion"" the first sentence states ""...the mean prevalence of the fully immunized child (FIC) was only 49%, indicating the poor state....."". No numbers on aggregated ""means"" for all countries are given anywhere in the Results section. It is therefore surprising that it appears in the Discussion section. It is not described how the authors calculated this mean prevalence. I suggest the sentence is taken out as it opens up to a different data analysis than the one used in the article (where data from each country are presented separately and compared.)On top of page ""capital"" should be ""capita"".In the second column, it is said in the fourth paragraph (starting ""Even with a probability...) that ""Clusters with a larger population are more likely to be selected compared to less populated clusters..:"" This is not correct. The cluster sampling is not a method in which you select your sample
from clusters. It is a method through which you select clusters from a population enumeration based on an estimate or  census data. All persons in the population have the same chance of being included in a cluster, irrespective of there they live. In EPI coverage surveys a cluster typically consists of 7 children.In the ""Conclusions"" section it is said that ""Health system weaknesses and inefficiencies responsible for the unacceptably high dropout rates between vaccine doses need to be tackled urgently."" However true this may be, there is in fact little to no evidence in the article that health system weaknesses and inefficiencies are responsible for the drop out rates documented in the surveys. The reason is that this variable is not included in the regression model. It would be possible, but not easy and uncontroversial, to include a proxy for such system weaknesses in the model but rather than redoing their analysis, I suggest the authors move the quoted sentence to the ""Discussion"" section and then qualify their statement. The ""Conclusion"" section should focus on the actual results from the study and their policy implications.

It is well-written and presents a useful picture of the situation of a group of countries and highlights that there is much work to do in terms of improving coverage and reducing drop-outs. It also shows that the factors associated with FIC differ among countries. The main issue I have with the study is that it only presents coverage point estimates. It fails to show the % of cards seen and confidence intervals around estimates. This limits data interpretation. Also, at least to me, it is not clear if the authors were able to replicate the results included in the respective DHS report. If it was a re-analysis, it is frequent that estimates are a bit different due to non-explicit decisions on record or data point exclusion, or how to treat “don’t know” responses, for example. This is not mentioned. Also, by calling the drop-out DTP1-DTP3 an “access” issue and the drop-out DTP1-MCV1 a “utilization” issue, it creates confusion, as often DTP1 coverage is used to denote access and drop-out (any) to denote utilization.

However, we have concerns with the amalgamation of data from different years in different countries. For example, the authors combine 2008 data from Ghana and 2014 data from Togo, to give an overall estimate of vaccination coverage in West Africa. To which year did the authors assign the 49% mean vaccination coverage for West Africa? In the same vein, if the authors were asked to assess whether West Africa achieved the GVAP coverage target for 2015 (using the two countries mentioned above as examples), would they be comfortable combining 2009 data for Ghana and 2015 coverage data for Togo to give 2015 figures for the region?Specific comments 
In the abstract, the authors should mention the years for the coverage data.We do not think that the average coverage reported for West Africa is informative, for the reason stated above.For the average coverage data, the median and range would be more informative than mean and range.The authors refer to “…a trend of increasing vaccination coverage…” in the abstract. If this trend is over time, would it not be helpful to indicate the years of interest?We found it difficult to understand the concept of “risk factor for full immunization coverage” in this study. Could there be a more informative phrase than “risk factor” in this context? Is maternal education a risk factor for vaccination in a similar sense to smoking being a risk for lung cancer?Given that vaccination coverage was assessed from records in vaccination cards, we doubt whether it is appropriate to put “possession of a vaccination card” in the multivariate logistic regression model.It would be helpful in the abstract, to provide the effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals for the respective effects on vaccination coverage of maternal education, delivery in a health facility, etc.The authors report “Chi-square tests were utilized in univariate analyses to examine associations between FIC and possible risk factors”. Should the analyses be referred to as “bivariate”, given that the authors examined the relationship between two variables?

The authors describe scenarios in which the so-called exclusion restriction might be violated and then describe analytic approaches to address the potential bias in IV estimates that could arise. The article is clearly written with apt examples and is very thorough, especially with the abundant supplemental materials including code. This manuscript is likely to be valuable to the community of researchers interested in IV applications to maternal-child associations. There are several issues that it would be helpful if the authors could address to make the manuscript a more comprehensive resource.  
The authors describe the usefulness of examining associations between the maternal genetic IV and measured confounders under several different conditions (page 4). However, it is not clear how to optimally address associations between the genetic IV and measured confounders (see comment 2a below) as the bias introduced by such IV-confounder associations on the IV-outcome association estimate are not always clear.
1
It would help if the authors could specifically address adaptation of their simulation-based sensitivity analyses to examine pleiotropy. Two examples that came to mind when reading the manuscript:  
In the example evaluating a genetic IV to examine the association between maternal pregnancy BMI and childhood BMI, the authors describe associations between the IV and measured confounders (social class and parity). Depending on how the DAG is conceived, one could see this as an example of pleiotropy leading to a violation of the IV assumption that all directed paths from the IV to the outcome pass through maternal pregnancy BMI (especially for parity if there is a causal association between BMI genetic variants and parity). Furthermore, there might be plausible paths connecting the BMI IV, maternal pregnancy BMI, parity, and the outcome that would suggest that bias could be introduced by including parity as a covariate in either the multivariable regression or the IV analysis. Could the authors address their choice to include social class but not parity in their multivariable regression model and discuss adaptations of their simulations to address possible contributions of pleiotropy to IV estimates?The authors’ discussion of assortative mating is clear. However, they do not address the scenario in which the assortment occurs not on the exposure of interest but on a correlated trait (e.g. if the exposure of interest is maternal diabetes, IV is a genetic risk score for diabetes, outcome of interest is childhood BMI or glucose levels, and assortative mating might occur on the basis of maternal/paternal BMI). In this scenario, accounting for paternal and offspring diabetes genetic variants is unlikely to block all paths between the IV and outcome that do not go through the exposure of interest, and adding covariates related to assortment (maternal and/or paternal BMI) might induce bias in the IV-outcome association estimate. While this is essentially a special case of pleiotropy, it may be worth making the distinction between assortment based on the exposure of interest (for which the IV is selected) and assortment based on traits correlated with the exposure of interest. The impact of the latter case on the IV-outcome estimate can likely be addressed through simulation as well.
The authors do not include offspring genetic variants for BMI in their multivariable regression model in the example derived from ALSPAC data. This would seem to inflate the difference in estimates of exposure-outcome association compared to the IV-outcome association (since offspring genetic variants are included in the IV analysis but not in the multivariable regression). While this does not affect the causal effect estimate from the IV analysis, it does impact any statistical test for difference in effect estimates comparing the multivariable regression model and the IV model. Can the authors address this discrepancy?Two additional sources of bias in IV estimates that are not unique to maternal-offspring IV analyses arise from additional assumptions
2 that the authors do not describe in their manuscript: 1. The assumption of no effect modification by the instrument on the exposure-outcome association; 2. The assumption of monotonicity between instrument and exposure. In the context of genetic instruments for which we infrequently understand the causal variants or biological pathways involved, the assumption of no effect modification is difficult to verify. Similarly, when a genetic instrument is used for a dichotomous exposure (e.g. diabetes or obesity), the monotonicity assumption is not always satisfied (some mothers with a heavy burden of diabetes-associated genetic variants might not develop pre-pregnancy or gestational diabetes). It might be helpful to include a brief discussion of sources of bias common to all genetic IV analyses, irrespective of whether an intrauterine exposure is of interest, that warrant consideration.

Our comments are reported below.1) Introduction a. ”However, evidence that the proxy measures used by IADPSG developers to indicate offspring obesity (high birth weight, birth skinfolds and cord-blood c-peptide) are accurate predictors of future risk of childhood obesity, or that treating women with the IADPSG criteria will effectively reduce childhood obesity, is lacking”. It would be important to clearly distinguish between prediction and the possibility to prevent obesity through interventions, as the former concept does not require causation. b. “In other areas women’s lifestyle in pregnancy is potentially being blamed for all future health risks in her offspring”. This statement is maybe too strong; in addition strong evidence of causation (or lack of causation) would not solve the blaming component.  c. “However, conventional methods are unlikely to be suitable [to provide valid causal statements]”. Also this statement is maybe too strong. We agree that residual confounding is a major issue for causal inference from observational data, but there are several examples of valid causal inference based on observational studies analysed using conventional approaches.  2) Section “Maternal genetic instrumental variables are not associated with potential confounders of the pregnancy exposure- offspring outcome association”  a. “Therefore, we recommend testing associations between maternal variants and observed potential confounders with and without adjustment for offspring (and paternal) genetic variants when such adjustments are used in the main MR analyses”.  We have some difficulties in understanding the practical implications of this recommendation. It could be useful to add the offspring genetic variants in the DAG reported in Figure 1 to understand what would be the impact of this adjustment on the IV – potential confounders associations. Furthermore, it would be good to clarify the concept of “testing” in this context: is it a statistical test, a judgment on the magnitude of the associations, is it at an univariable or multivariable level?3) Section "" Maternal genetic instrumental variables are only related to the offspring outcome through their relationship to the maternal pregnancy exposure (the exclusion restriction assumption)"" a. We wonder if the offspring genetic variants could also affect the maternal exposures during pregnancy. It is probably unlikely, but not impossible. This would have implications for the scenario described in Supplementary File 1. b. Figure 2 and the last two sentences on page 5  “Thus, it is rarely possible to be able to deal with this potential new bias by adjusting for paternal (as well as offspring) genetic variants…”.  Cohorts could have information on paternal characteristics e.g. paternal BMI, paternal physical activity, smoking and other phenotypes. Adjustment for paternal phenotypes could block the path B1-->B2àB3 (even if the paternal phenotype would then become a collider). c. In our opinion, maternal postnatal exposures are potent potential sources of bias, whenever these exposures act on the offspring outcome through various pathways. For example maternal obesity might act on the offspring through different pathways involving diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviours, etc. A similar comment regards Figure 3 and page 7 – second paragraph – maternal exposure of interest as behaviour “visible” to their offspring and last sentence of the same paragraph (“less visible” exposures). We would not define these postnatal exposures as “visible” or “less visible”. In Figure 3 maternal alcohol consumption might affect offspring cognitive function or other outcomes by mechanisms other than “imitating”. In this specific case mothers with such exposures might have different child-care practice or create diverse environment where child grows that could influence later cognitive function. Maybe “manifest” and “not manifest” would work better [for example we used this terminology in Richiardi L
et al. 2013]4) Section ""Testing effects using maternal non-transmitted genetic variants ."" a. We should admit that we have not fully understood the inherent assumptions of the analysis restricted to the non-transmitted allele. For example, wouldn’t this imply an inherent conditioning on the offspring genetic variants?5) Supplementary file 1 a. “If offspring BMI is assessed in adulthood then this association is likely to be the case, as the BMI variants will relate to BMI with the same magnitude in adult mothers and their offspring when BMI is assessed in adulthood”. It should be considered however that the maternal exposure is assessed in pregnancy, while the offspring is not. Thus the strength of the IV might be different even if the assessment is made at the same age (in general, the assumption of identical effects is very stringent and it is easy to come up with examples in which this assumption is violated).6) Illustrative example using real data a. If the standardization of the BMI is not necessary for the application of the method, we would suggest using the actual BMI in the analysis instead of BMI SDs (at least it would be good to report the magnitude of 1 SD BMI, if not already shown in the manuscript). b. Maybe it is out of the scope of this manuscript, but it would be interesting to discuss the implications of a possible baseline selection related with pre-pregnancy BMI in this cohort (e.g. obese mothers were more -or less- likely to participate in the study). Wouldn’t this be a source of violation of the exclusion restriction assumption (and a possible explanation for the association between the genetic score and SES and parity?) c. “For both BMI and FMI there was statistical evidence that the effects that both of our main MR methods were statistically inconsistent with the association from multivariable regression analyses (all p-values < 0.03)”. It seems that something is missing in this sentence. d. Page 11: “In the simulation analyses we examined results assuming a true null result and also a true positive effect of 0.2SD change in the offspring BMI/GFMI per 1SD change in maternal pregnancy BMI” Is this effect supported by the literature?

The paper considers 3 major issues that could arise when using MR to estimate the effect of maternal attributes on offspring outcomes, shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. It would be very helpful if at the beginning of the section ""Mendelian randomization assumptions and assessing causal intrauterine effects"" these three different issues were introduced, before discussing Figure 1. In Figure 1 it seems a bit redundant to write the IV assumptions because they can be read off the directed acyclic graph. However it may help some readers. In everyday life it is generally understood that causes, when relevant, act consistently. It seems unnecessary to test that genetic variants act the same in pregnant women as at other times. Instead, it might only be necessary to test that genetic variants act consistently if there was some reason to think otherwise.  The explanation for the result that in some cases the unadjusted MR result can be corrected by subtracting 0.5 (pages 7/8) needs to be included in the text, at least as an intuitive explanation, not just given in a Supplementary File.  From the regularity of the patterns in Table 1 it looks like there is an analytic solution for the simulation. If such an analytic solution could be found and added to the paper it would be very helpful and make the paper more generally applicable. Does weak instrument bias also likely inflate the estimate?

There are specific challenges that arise in such studies, as the IV used for the maternal exposure is likely correlated with genetic factors in the offspring which could affect offspring outcomes (violating the exclusion restriction). Also, adjusting for offspring genotype could introduce collider bias. This paper describes these (and other) potential biases and recommends approaches for avoiding these biases. No major changes suggested, but I have a few comments that may help improve the paper:
It seems that the real data example used here was very recently published by the authors in PLOS Medicine. Assuming this is true, I suggest acknowledging this somewhere with a comment on how the data analysis presented here is different or expands on the published work, or if it is essentially the same.   The authors state that assortative mating could result in bias. Is this an issue specific to maternal exposures? Or a more general problem for any MR study?Figure 3 describes violations of the ER due to pre- and post-natal pathways. Based on this example (alcohol consumption), it seems reasonable to suspect that if one variant violates the exclusion restriction then all variants use as IV(s) would potentially violate the exclusion restriction through the same pathway. So in this case, would MR-egger and median methods might not be useful (as suggested they would be on page 9)? If not, perhaps an alternative example would better illustrate the point you’re trying to make.The authors state that maternal exposures will typically be studied in the one-sample setting (page 10), which can be problematic for MR-egger. This was counter-intuitive to me because information on the IV-maternal exposure association can be obtained from external data sets and use in a two-sample MR analysis. My confusion was later cleared up in the discussion, where the authors mention that this 2-sample approach is possible. In my opinion, it is not necessary to wait until the discussion to make this point. Furthermore, you may want to reconsider the claim that maternal exposures will generally be studies in the one-sample MR setting.    Minor comments:
Commas placement not correct: “The simulation studies suggest that whether we assume a null, or positive, association the MR method …”“Pre/post-pregnancy” is used in text, while “pre/post-natal” is used in Figure 3. Better to be consistent. Title and abstract are reasonable, but consider a more concise title.

The work of the team is extensive; the topic important; the findings impressive and scholarly. The Background section is particularly well documented and encompassing, nicely setting up the context for this work. We appreciated the combination of pediatric and adult palliative care concerns. We were especially moved by the uncovering of global inequities and injustices (e.g., pain medication), and impressed with the diversity, specificity as well as critical engagement enabled by the taxonomy (and we applaud the resistance to simplification!). We were also appreciative of the careful attention to scholars such as Rawls to help conceptualize the project.Suggested revisions: Given that we feel this paper has the potential to make a substantial contribution to palliative care research, we spent considerable time grappling with how best to convey its strengths. Ultimately, we feel more work is needed to convey clearly the creative yet rigorous process involved in creating the taxonomy, while also underscoring the scholarly potential of this work. It feels to us that there may be two papers contained in this one manuscript. While we leave this to the authors to decide, we do feel that dividing the current work into a) a more detailed methodological section, followed by b) a section that then discusses the true potential of this provisional taxonomy (e.g., as a tool for synergy, synthesis, elaboration, and evaluation) may be more fruitful. Details follow.  
The appropriateness of the title
Title: As suggested above, we believe there are multiple elements contained in this one manuscript. The title is descriptive of only one, however: the presentation of the taxonomy. It thus misses the other elements (e.g., the rigorous development of a creative new tool; the potential utility of this tool for the field of palliative care globally).  
Whether the abstract provides an adequate summary of the article
Abstract: Our concerns with the Abstract parallel our concerns with the paper (as outlined more fully below). Currently, the Methods section defines the term “interventions” yet lacks description of the methods. The taxonomy is described as “comprehensive” which seems inconsistent with the more provisional language used in the text (e.g., p5, para1: the authors note the taxonomy is not necessarily exhaustive and is open to future elaboration). The Abstract locates methodological decisions (e.g., conceptualizing categories with the heuristics: locus, focus, frames and instruments) in the Findings and thereby downplays their roles in actually shaping the Findings. Similarly, topics we feel should be developed in the Discussion section (e.g., Rawls on overlapping consensus) appear in the Conclusion. [And note: the use of the word ‘range’ to describe the interventions is perhaps incommensurate with the conception of overlapping consensus.]  
If there is a comprehensive explanation of study design, methods and analysis, and their suitability to the investigation
Methods: We would like to see a more robust discussion of the creative process used to develop this taxonomy. The iterative methodology employed has clearly produced a thoughtful tool with great utility. We feel that it behooves the authors to more clearly distinguish the data gathering from the conceptual processes used in its development. The main Objective is “to generate a taxonomy of end of life interventions wherein they are ordered and named in a system of classification” (p4; para5). While this taxonomy has been generated, the actual processes of that generation are less clear. The metaphor of the “road map” is used (p5, para7); however, we feel more careful explanation of this mapping is required. This descriptive work will better set up the authors’ future goal of establishing “a more evaluative, situated and concrete position” (same paragraph). For instance, a Table itemizing the data sources would have great utility. Currently, claims of ‘global’ coverage and ‘wide reading’ are not well evidenced given the reader does not have access to the data sources. Reference is made to the kinds of data sources (p5, para3); more detail is needed, at least in broad strokes (perhaps in an Appendix). We suggest then moving the “four distinct benefits” (p4, para5) to the
Discussion, and using these as a scaffold for the
Discussion. Currently, what appears in the
Discussion is actually evidence to back up the analytic decisions made and thus would have more utility in the
Methods section. This information will help explain how the empirical data was parsed from the conceptual processes in the category development. [And note: we believe that what is currently in the
Conclusion (e.g., the concern about the evidence base, the critique of under-theorized, biomedically-focused end-of-life research, and the utility of Rawls’ work) is actually important fodder for the
Discussion.] Similarly, reference is made in the
Findings to key information that assisted the methodological decisions. For example, p5, para5 makes reference to focus vs. locus; para6 refers to the macro, meso, micro and individual dimensions of the classification; and later in the
Discussion is reference to frames vs. instruments. Referencing and discussing these important constructs (called ‘themes’ in the
Conclusion, para1) outside the methods section downplays their roles in shaping the 10 categories; this placement thereby also obscures how inductive or deductive the category development was. An aside for consideration: Distinguishing the taxonomy-building methodology from a more conventional methodology (e.g., a scoping review) could also be helpful. This comment is both to underscore the originality of the team’s choice, while also to help orient the reader to the
Findings. Currently, there are references throughout the
Findings which signal empirical data (e.g., dignity therapy) as well as conceptual frames (e.g., philosophy of education). Following a scoping review methodology, one would expect only empirical data to be referenced in the
Findings, perhaps with a Table at the end listing the data sources used. As currently presented, it is not always clear if the references indicate an intervention being categorized, or a conceptual justification for that categorization. Note also: The justification for the label “taxonomy” seems cumbersome and the foray into biological taxonomy and Plato is distracting. Perhaps simply finding reference to a kindred use of ‘taxonomy’ (e.g., from Nursing literature) could provide a clearer, more robust explanation and justification for the ability of this term to beget the constructive intention of the methodology, still with the Rawlsian intent. Further, an earlier explanation of how the notion of “overlapping consensus” was applied to or inspired the development of the taxonomy would enhance the reader’s comprehension. Though the Rawlsian concept is well explained in the
Conclusion, understanding earlier how it applied in this work (e.g., for deriving the taxonomy or as a conceptual foundation for the whole project) would greatly contribute clarity.Findings: Table 1 nicely covers the categories. We were uneasy, however, with the labels for Category 4, 9 and 10. #4: We questioned the neologism, “ethico-legal,” and would argue that more is lost than gained by lumping together these two domains in one word. #9: “Intangible” sets up a false dichotomy and can be seen to devalue these sorts of interventions. #10: The title “self-determined” may be too Western to have global reach.

It does offers researchers in the field a conceptual framework to consult or refer to. I believe that it is a foundational survey work that will lead to many other important projects. The main contribution of this paper is that it does identify the niche in the field that a grounded and evidence-based work is badly needed while policies, clinical guidelines, pedagogical plans and research agenda are being drafted or established. I would like to congratulate the authors of this paper for the groundwork they have laid down and the gateways they have paved. There are, however, several points I think authors might consider to improve the article. First is the methodology: the scope of the survey is extensive and ambitious. The authors also use several paragraphs signposting and explaining why the survey is important. However, in addition to “why” and “what” the categories of end-of-life issues are, it might be worthwhile to elaborate more regarding to “who”, “when”, and “how” the study in the end came across such taxonomy. Although the authors have described that the data are from the “wide reading, intense multidisciplinary team discussion and debate, and through presentation to and feedback from expert international audiences in conference settings”, and the selection stages of “identification, individuation and classification”, it will be more convincing if the authors could specify, e.g. How long was the study period? The examples of interventions collected spanned from when to when? In what countries were the examples collected? What databases are used? What are the analytical methods? In addition, it would be great if authors can detail how categories of interventions are singled out. Are there any coding methods employed? What are the criteria? Why ethico-legal interventions and clinical interventions must be distinguished categories… Aren’t they somehow the results of policy-making and advocacy? Second, in the introduction, the authors claim that the work aims to secure an
overlapping consensus in John Rawls’ term. Is it the top instructive principle of data collection or the finding after data are collected? Readers might want to know if there are any findings that do not support the “overlapping consensus” discourse. In addition to the observed consensus, are there any contesting categories? There are also several minor technical problems that, I think, can be improved easily. In the article, the tones and writing styles of different parts are not consistent. The context part especially reads more colloquial. Apart from that, readers might be confused about what arguments are made in existing research, and what are suggested by authors in this paper. It also contains a number of redundant expressions. For example, (in the first page first paragraph line 3) “indeed”, (second paragraph line 1) “should”, (line 8) “as much as”, (paragraph 4 first line) “something that must”. It would be great to streamline these paragraphs. But these problems should be easily solved.I have read this submission.

The title is clear and unambiguous and articulates what the article entails. The abstract provides and appropriate summary of the article giving a real sense of what to expect. The context is well constructed and sets out the space where the debate is taking place about palliative and end of life and death. The objectives are coherent and realistic in their intent. The method used to arrive at the taxonomy described is articulated well and with authority. The authors are intent on ensuring that what is presented is a guide based on evidence and expert discussion and opinion and should be taken as functional and pragmatic. I believe the taxonomy presented is a very balanced one which clearly focuses on what the authors describe as frames and instruments as a means of arriving at consensus to support the practical. The work in my opinion is timely and will be of interest to all those engaged in the work of palliative and end of life care and particularly those who are engaged in the discussions of how best we provide end of life interventions in the world today.I have read this submission.

It is from a well-designed study from a longitudinal community household study in rural Kenya from whom collections of respiratory secretions were collected with and without bias with respect to symptomatology. As such, it is a very valuable database to assess many important clinical questions. These authors attempt to leverage this impressive dataset to evaluate quantitative virology relationships to clinical and epidemiological endpoints. This is a very valuable goal and they have generated results and analyses that are important, however, there are numerous problems with this approach which deserve to be reviewed, and their conclusions need to be modified in light of these limitations. 
Relatively non-quantitative collection technique: Unfortunately, because of the nature of the study (outpatient from village homes), the collections themselves had to be performed using a swab technique. Swab collections (even if done using a deep swab approach) have been shown to produce specimens that are difficult to use for quantitative virology. Variations in depth of swab acquisition, variations in depth of the transition zone from squamous to respiratory epithelial cells within the nose, reduced sensitivity caused by the small volume collection and the large volume dilution required during the nucleic acid extraction technique, and sample to sample variations of the PCR technique (which can not be overcome by re-running the specimen because of lack of sufficient collection volume) all contribute to creating this relatively non-quantitative collection technique.Relatively non-quantitative PCR techniques employed: Molecular quantification of viruses within a sample requires a standard curve to assign a quantitative value based upon a Ct value. One cannot use the Ct value itself without it being read from a standard curve. These standard curves can be created externally from the PCR run itself (less desirable) or can be created internally during the actual run which includes the unknown samples from the patients themselves (more desirable). The creation and design of the standard curves is extremely important in determination of quantification and can be based on whole viral genome from infected cells (thereby controlling for the nucleic acid extraction and purification steps, and controlling for the reverse transcriptase step). Less optimal (but much easier to construct) standard curves can be created that utilize cloned cDNA (easily giving a copy number, but not properly controlling for either the nucleic acid extraction, purification, nor reverse transcription steps). Unfortunately, this study apparently has not constructed standard curves, and they rely solely on generated Ct values to imply quantity. It is, in some cases, acceptable to do so when using a single-plex assay (where relative viral concentrations can fairly be compared to the same technique on different specimens). But this approach is never acceptable to use when multiplexed assays are employed (see below). Introduction of technique-driven systemic bias in molecular quantification: This molecular quantification bias comes in two forms:  A) multiplex-PCRs detect viral amplicon differently when there are two molecular targets within the same sample based on competition for ions, primers, and probes, and enzymes within the reaction. B) The relative amplification efficiency (and the probe-binding-induced fluorescent signal read out by the PCR machine, will be different depending on the probe and the amplicon size and the relative binding efficiencies of the forward and reverse primers. This makes it impossible to quantitatively assess the quantification of two different viruses (RSV-A and B) within a mixed sample and also makes it impossible to compare one target’s quantity (RSV-A) with another target’s quantity (RSV-B). Failure to evaluate infectious viral particles and using non-infectious viral particle counts to make conclusions about infectious viral load. The authors find and conclude that: “The majority of virus available for transmission during an RSV epidemic appears to arise from individuals in their first year of life and therefore undergoing their first RSV infection episode.” Although I agree with this statement, it is important to realize that from data within this manuscript itself, this statement assumes that infectious viral particles equate to quantitative PCR copy number. This assumption is certainly not true. Infectious virus particles are best quantified by a quantitative culture approach. Factors within the respiratory secretions themselves (such as IgA) have been shown to be associated with RSV culture negativity despite persistent high concentrations of RSV genome continuing to be detected within human respiratory secretions after a documented RSV infection
1,2. Infant’s ability to generate RSV-specific IgA is significantly less than the ability of adults to do so during an RSV infection
3,4. The author’s conclusion that infants likely contribute more than do adults to epidemic spread of RSV infection has been carefully modeled in a recent paper
5 in which two key factors; infectious viral particle quantity over time, and quantitative measures of human contact activity during times of infection, were incorporated into the model. The implications of these factors promoting RSV community spread should influence the types of RSV vaccines to be developed and the age ranges targeted by these vaccines, and these different vaccine scenarios have been modeled
5.Questions regarding viral load area under the curve calculations. Any area is geometrically and mathematically defined by multiplying two linear dimensions together. The same is true for viral load area under the curve (in this paper it is called viral density area under the curve for some reason). Viral load AUC is Viral load (units) multiplied by Time (units). The resulting units of viral load are always containing the unit of time. (For example “log PFUe x days”, or “Copies x hours”). The units of viral load AUC in this paper are incorrect and need to be redefined. When one realizes the mathematical definition of AUC, then it is no surprise that Fig 2a and 2b show a lot of correlation between duration of shedding and AUC (because time (duration) is actually in the denominator of the AUC value). Problems of determining co-infection with RSV-A and RSV-B. Students of RSV need to be very careful in reporting and interpreting data regarding co-infections. This paper is no exception. This paper and others assume that when a multiplexed assay reports that the wavelength of the excited probe is orange and another wavelength of the excited probe is green (I am giving a hypothetical example) that this means that both RSV-A and B are present in the sample. However this may or may not be the case. For example, if the virus is an RSV-A virus, the probe for RSV-A binds relatively tightly to the amplicon through strict base-pair matching, and then cleavage of the reporter molecule from the quencher molecule allows the detection of the amplicon (through inhibition of FRET). However, it is very possible that the RSV-B probe will also bind to the amplicon at a certain number of base pairs, and this can result in the RSV-B reporter being detected (erroneously causing the authors to read that RSV-B is also present in the sample). Because of this problem, this paper’s results, analyses, and conclusions regarding “co-infections” of RSV-A and B need to be taken with caution.Problems with co-infections with RSV and other respiratory viruses (Adeno, Rhinoviruses, and Coronaviruses). RSV infection causes massive shedding of respiratory epithelial cells into the airway lumen (which are then collected by the swab technique). Any persistent virus present in those shed cells will therefore be detected at higher frequency during an RSV infection. This is an alternative explanation of the correlation between viral load of RSV and detection of these other infections (Top of Pg. 8). This phenomenon carries much different implications than are assumed to be present by these authors. Associations with age and outcome (area under the curve viral load). The authors do an excellent job of assessing the associations between area under the curve and other factors. After observing the problems with the actual viral load area under the curve measurements themselves, (see points 1,2,3,5 above) it appears that their data shows that the primary host characteristic that affects area under the curve viral load is whether or not children have had a prior RSV infection. This fits with other data from the literature. However, it would be nice to know whether young age within the infant age category was predictive of increased area under the curve viral load. Unfortunately, the data set does not contain data on age in weeks, days, or months within the first year of life. I suspect that younger ages within the infant age range, i.e. the RSV-naïve population, will be related to the area under the curve viral load. Other databases will likely need to be leveraged in order to determine this important question. Although the number of infant infections in this database will likely be small, the authors should attempt to break down the ages within the infant age range in order to try to answer this important question. The infant antiviral functional immune response is likely not fully developed at birth, and RSV can be used to interrogate the ontogeny of this immune response
6, which can have major implications on vaccine development.Associations with other factors and outcome (area under the curve viral load). The manuscript also indicates that presence of respiratory symptoms, intra-household acquisition of infection, being a first infection episode in the season for an individual, and having a co-infection were associated with increased amounts of RSV shed. We should think about the root causes of these associations so that we can understand principles of RSV infection. I do not know the intricacies of the subject acquisition and identification, but is it possible that intra-household transmission simply is a surrogate marker for earlier swabbing of the patient? We know that viral load peaks in the nose shortly after symptom onset, and that viral load declines thereafter. Therefore, having a first swab earlier would create a subject with a greater viral load AUC. An alternative explanation is that perhaps an inoculum effect is present and that children are inoculated within a household transmission with greater amounts of virus, thus causing greater AUC viral load. Past studies have tried to determine an inoculum effect for RSV and crowding does not seem to be a predictor of viral load
7,8. Likewise, in experimental RSV infection models of adults, there appears to be little effect of inoculum on AUC viral load
2. It is likely that RSV inoculum affects whether a person becomes infected, but once that person is infected that inoculum has little effect on viral load, AUC or disease severity. I have addressed the issue of co-infection (and alternative explanations for the observed data) in points 6 and 7 above. Waning control of RSV infection with advanced age. Perhaps the greatest contribution of this paper to the medical literature is the finding that area under the curve viral load begins to rise again in adulthood after the age of 40. This is a fascinating finding, and could result from either immune senescence, or reduced exposure to boosting infections of RSV, or a combination of both.  Whether this adult age-related increase in RSV area under the curve viral load is similar in developed countries will need to be evaluated.    Overall this paper adds significantly to the medical literature into our understanding of RSV in communities. These authors should be lauded and encouraged in their efforts to extract as much information as possible from carefully constructed clinical trials.I have read this submission.

This variation is likely to be random and hence should not alter the patterns with respect to covariables, but make observations more noisy. We hope readers understand the limitations and the fact that there are no better collection alternatives.  2. Relatively non-quantitative PCR techniques employed: Molecular quantification of viruses within a sample requires a standard curve to assign a quantitative value based upon a Ct value. One cannot use the Ct value itself without it being read from a standard curve.

Inter-assay variation was assessed through repeated positive controls which were monitored each run. There is, of course, the underlying high degree of underlying biological variation referred to earlier which diminishes the value of downstream precision in RNA load estimation. Hence we recognise we are using only crude estimates, but these were the data available and they produce results which look epidemiologically sensible.   3. Introduction of technique-driven systemic bias in molecular quantification: This molecular quantification bias comes in two forms:  A) multiplex-PCRs detect viral amplicon differently when there are two molecular targets within the same sample based on competition for ions, primers, and probes, and enzymes within the reaction. B) The relative amplification efficiency (and the probe-binding-induced fluorescent signal read out by the PCR machine, will be different depending on the probe and the amplicon size and the relative binding efficiencies of the forward and reverse primers. This makes it impossible to quantitatively assess the quantification of two different viruses (RSV-A and B) within a mixed sample and also makes it impossible to compare one target’s quantity (RSV-A) with another target’s quantity (RSV-B). The observed increase in AUC for co-infections of RSV A and B relative to single infections is perplexing, so we thank the reviewer for the insights regarding interpretation of multiplex PCR data.  4. Failure to evaluate infectious viral particles and using non-infectious viral particle counts to make conclusions about infectious viral load. The authors find and conclude that: “The majority of virus available for transmission during an RSV epidemic appears to arise from individuals in their first year of life and therefore undergoing their first RSV infection episode.” Although I agree with this statement, it is important to realize that from data within this manuscript itself, this statement assumes that infectious viral particles equate to quantitative PCR copy number. This assumption is certainly not true. Infectious virus particles are best quantified by a quantitative culture approach. Factors within the respiratory secretions themselves (such as IgA) have been shown to be associated with RSV culture negativity despite persistent high concentrations of RSV genome continuing to be detected within human respiratory secretions after a documented RSV infection. Infant’s ability to generate RSV-specific IgA is significantly less than the ability of adults to do so during an RSV infection. The author’s conclusion that infants likely contribute more than do adults to epidemic spread of RSV infection has been carefully modeled in a recent paper in which two key factors; infectious viral particle quantity over time, and quantitative measures of human contact activity during times of infection, were incorporated into the model. The implications of these factors promoting RSV community spread should influence the types of RSV vaccines to be developed and the age ranges targeted by these vaccines, and these different vaccine scenarios have been modeled.We accept that a limitation of the original study was the absence of virus culture. A caution on inferring virus infectiousness using the PCR quantities is explicit in the paper. While further work will be required to link quantitative PCR copy numbers and infectiousness it is worth noting in a carefully designed human challenge studies viral load dynamics by qPCR mirror that of quantitative culture with qPCR consistently overestimating viral load mainly in the recovery phase. This provides evidence of direct proportional relationship between quantitative culture (a measure infectious virus) and qPCR (measuring both infectious and non-infectious viruses) (DeVincenzo, Wilkinson et al. 2010) hence our interpretation albeit with caution. 5. Questions regarding viral load area under the curve calculations. Any area is geometrically and mathematically defined by multiplying two linear dimensions together. The same is true for viral load area under the curve (in this paper it is called viral density area under the curve for some reason). Viral load AUC is Viral load (units) multiplied by Time (units). The resulting units of viral load are always containing the unit of time. (For example “log PFUe x days”, or “Copies x hours”). The units of viral load AUC in this paper are incorrect and need to be redefined. When one realizes the mathematical definition of AUC, then it is no surprise that Fig 2a and 2b show a lot of correlation between duration of shedding and AUC (because time (duration) is actually in the denominator of the AUC value).Thanks for pointing this out. We have changed the units to log 10 copies x days. 6. Problems of determining co-infection with RSV-A and RSV-B. Students of RSV need to be very careful in reporting and interpreting data regarding co-infections. This paper is no exception. This paper and others assume that when a multiplexed assay reports that the wavelength of the excited probe is orange and another wavelength of the excited probe is green (I am giving a hypothetical example) that this means that both RSV-A and B are present in the sample. However this may or may not be the case. For example, if the virus is an RSV-A virus, the probe for RSV-A binds relatively tightly to the amplicon through strict base-pair matching, and then cleavage of the reporter molecule from the quencher molecule allows the detection of the amplicon (through inhibition of FRET). However, it is very possible that the RSV-B probe will also bind to the amplicon at a certain number of base pairs, and this can result in the RSV-B reporter being detected (erroneously causing the authors to read that RSV-B is also present in the sample). Because of this problem, this paper’s results, analyses, and conclusions regarding “co-infections” of RSV-A and B need to be taken with caution.Co-detection of RSV A and B were in 19 NPS collections yielding to 14 different infection episodes in 7 households. 4 out of the 7 households had more than one co-infection episode. While acknowledging the challenges of interpreting co-infection data, the outgoingobservations of clustering of the co-detections by individual and co-infection episodes by households does not point to spurious findings.   7. Problems with co-infections with RSV and other respiratory viruses (Adeno, Rhinoviruses, and Coronaviruses). RSV infection causes massive shedding of respiratory epithelial cells into the airway lumen (which are then collected by the swab technique). Any persistent virus present in those shed cells will therefore be detected at higher frequency during an RSV infection. This is an alternative explanation of the correlation between viral load of RSV and detection of these other infections (Top of Pg. 8). This phenomenon carries much different implications than are assumed to be present by these authors.The reverse argument is also possible. A higher proportion of shed cells would be infected with RSV. Unless concurrent infections were actually in the very same cells (rather than infecting other cells) then this sloughed material would actually have less co-infection than the remaining intact cells.  In addition, the enhanced sloughing of the epithelial cells would have been prominent in symptomatic infection episodes where secretions will have ‘washed’ a larger surface area and the later is adjusted for in our analyses.      8. Associations with age and outcome (area under the curve viral load). The authors do an excellent job of assessing the associations between area under the curve and other factors. After observing the problems with the actual viral load area under the curve measurements themselves, (see points 1,2,3,5 above) it appears that their data shows that the primary host characteristic that affects area under the curve viral load is whether or not children have had a prior RSV infection. This fits with other data from the literature. However, it would be nice to know whether young age within the infant age category was predictive of increased area under the curve viral load. Unfortunately, the data set does not contain data on age in weeks, days, or months within the first year of life. I suspect that younger ages within the infant age range, i.e. the RSV-naïve population, will be related to the area under the curve viral load. Other databases will likely need to be leveraged in order to determine this important question. Although the number of infant infections in this database will likely be small, the authors should attempt to break down the ages within the infant age range in order to try to answer this important question. The infant antiviral functional immune response is likely not fully developed at birth, and RSV can be used to interrogate the ontogeny of this immune response, which can have major implications on vaccine development.A very good suggestion though our analyses showed no apparent relationship between age and AUC for infants under 1 year. This is why we did not break down age further for this category. 9. Associations with other factors and outcome (area under the curve viral load). The manuscript also indicates that presence of respiratory symptoms, intra-household acquisition of infection, being a first infection episode in the season for an individual, and having a co-infection were associated with increased amounts of RSV shed. We should think about the root causes of these associations so that we can understand principles of RSV infection.I do not know the intricacies of the subject acquisition and identification, but is it possible that intra-household transmission simply is a surrogate marker for earlier swabbing of the patient? We know that viral load peaks in the nose shortly after symptom onset, and that viral load declines thereafter. Therefore, having a first swab earlier would create a subject with a greater viral load AUC. An alternative explanation is that perhaps an inoculum effect is present and that children are inoculated within a household transmission with greater amounts of virus, thus causing greater AUC viral load. Past studies have tried to determine an inoculum effect for RSV and crowding does not seem to be a predictor of viral load. Likewise, in experimental RSV infection models of adults, there appears to be little effect of inoculum on AUC viral load. It is likely that RSV inoculum affects whether a person becomes infected, but once that person is infected that inoculum has little effect on viral load, AUC or disease severity. I have addressed the issue of co-infection (and alternative explanations for the observed data) in points 6 and 7 above. Swabs were collected regardless of symptom status and days of collections were planned to coincide for all members in same household unless someone was away. Therefore swabbing in early phase of infection (when viral load was high) would have occurred by chance and would influence the observed associations towards null. 10. Waning control of RSV infection with advanced age. Perhaps the greatest contribution of this paper to the medical literature is the finding that area under the curve viral load begins to rise again in adulthood after the age of 40. This is a fascinating finding, and could result from either immune senescence, or reduced exposure to boosting infections of RSV, or a combination of both.  Whether this adult age-related increase in RSV area under the curve viral load is similar in developed countries will need to be evaluated.Indeed this is an intriguing observation. We have interpreted this finding with caution since we had rather small sample size for these age group i.e. 9 episodes from 8 infected participants. DeVincenzo, J. P., T. Wilkinson, A. Vaishnaw, J.

The introduction and rationale for the study are very clearly provided. More complicated is the analysis to determine minimum and maximum areas under the curve representing estimates of the total amount of virus shed based on a PCR cycle to detection of virus. Once this is accepted the analysis of factors influencing the amount of virus detected is straightforward and indicates age, symptoms, RSV type B, and whether infection is the initial infection during the sampling period. Each of these observations remained significant in a multiple linear regression analysis. None of these observations are surprising but all are of interest in this locale and within a community based study design.

NA,NA,Wathuo,Miriam,NA,"KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya",NA,"1. Might the large number of asymptomatic individuals include some who subsequently became symptomatic and were at the time of sampling in the incubation period of their illness? Being symptomatic or not was defined both by individuals and by episodes. An episode was described as asymptomatic if the individual never had any respiratory illness symptoms during the entire duration of the infection episode. An episode was described as symptomatic if the individual had respiratory illness symptoms at least once during the episode.An individual was described as symptomatic if they had respiratory illness symptoms at least once during the study period, and asymptomatic if they never had any respiratory illness symptoms throughout the study period.Of the 71 individuals with asymptomatic episodes, 19 (26.8%) subsequently developed symptoms within one week. The subsequent symptoms were not linked to any virus detection in 15 (78.9%) of the 19 individuals. 2. Other things that might be considered include an analysis based gradation of symptoms in terms of virus recovered, whether frequency of sampling was influenced by symptoms, and patterns of spread within families.Sampling was done irrespective of symptom status and the frequency of sampling was not influenced by symptoms. Mild symptoms (mainly cough and running nose) were observed among the symptomatic cases hence difficult to grade the disease severity – no severe or very severe pneumonia cases. Nevertheless, there was no association between symptom status and virus type. The patterns of spread within households and role of asymptomatic cases has been discussed in detail in previous papers: Munywoki PK, Koech DC, Agoti CN, et al.

Rogier,NA,"1Oxford University Clinical Research Unit- Hanoi, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme, National Hospital of Tropical Diseases, Hanoi, Vietnam",approve-with-reservations,"This is an interesting paper using area under curve (AUC), derived from non-quantitative PCR data using three different estimates, as a unit to measure viral shedding during an RSV season 8 years ago for a prospective cohort of 47 households in rural coastal Kenya. AUC can take variability of viral load due to different factors (technical, biological) into account and reflects the overall temporal changes of virus shed. The authors use three models for calculating the AUC. While this is not my expertise, I cannot comment on these models, but I strongly believe that choosing an appropriate model is one of the most crucial parts of this study, any wrong assumption/ formula of these models will affect the results and its interpretations. Hence, the introduction of AUC as a measurement unit for transmission studies is an interesting concept, however, it may need a validation step using data from animal models, human challenge models, or clinical data monitoring RSV load. Below are some points requiring more clarification:
The interval between samples is 3-4 day, why did the author choose this big interval, while previous human challenge studies have suggested daily sampling or every 2 days could be the best follow-up (1). This is a major limitation as samples are taken only every 3-4 days and amounts of shed virus are therefore modelled based on little data and many assumptions, which may or may not equal out. The authors should definitely include more information on how their semi-quantitative data was calibrated.As authors didn’t use qPCR and use of a standard curve is not described, authors should clarify how they ensured PCR efficiency was stable between runs and what was used to calibrate runs and Ct values. This is a crucial thing to add, as all results in this paper are based on (semi)quantitative measurements and therefore, proper quantification is absolutely key.At the beginning of the Methods section, the authors specified that the AUC was calculated using viral load in log scale, but later for the midpoint AUC, they used Ct-value, please clarify.Reference 21 and 23 are not accessibleWithout baseline demographics about the sampled cohort I find some of this information hard to interpret. Symptomatic infections would also be interesting to see by age group.In Table 1, it is not clear how the total AUC was calculated. Surprisingly, the number of RSV infection episodes in the young age group (less than 1 year old and less than 5 years old) is much lower (denominator?) than those in the age group of 5-15 years old, while many epidemiological data have shown the re-infection rates are higher in the young age group. There is no comment/discussion on this result. In addition, the number of RSV infection episodes and the AUC in “living with smokers” group were lower and similar, respectively, compared to those who do not live with smokers. This result is controversial with the common observations from many epidemiological studies on RSV susceptibility and there is no comment/discussion regarding this. Specific minor comments: 
P3c1p2: The comparison with human volunteer studies to suggest load / inoculum may be associated with infection is not very strong, this may only be true in the background of a well-developed immune history against RSV whereas the main burden of disease of RSV is in infants who will not have this history yet.P3c1p3: I don’t think excretion is proper terminology for the process of virus shedding (nor is viral density – which is used later on, p6).P3c1p4: the number of sampled household members and the inclusion criteria should be added here.P3c2p1: why were only adeno, corona and rhino targeted with the diagnostic PCR and not the influenzas, parainfluenzas and hMPV? This is a very limited definition of co-infection.            P6: Please clarify why data are presented as median (IQR) amounts of virus shed in one paragraph but then as mean amounts (95%CI) of virus shed in the other.P8c1p2: In Table 2 sex is not significant, but its mentioned here as an associated factor.P8c2p3: the result that timing within the season was (appeared?) associated with the amount of virus shed is presented in the discussion section, shouldn’t this also be presented as a result, with data and a p-value?P8c2p3: why is it of particular importance that 90.3% of virus shed is from individuals experiencing their first episode? Also, 179/208 episodes studied were first episodes.Table 2: the number of primary and secondary cases per age group would be informative here In summary, this paper reports important data on RSV transmission in a community setting; data on this subject is still scarce. This data is relevant for RSV vaccine and treatment development and can help suggest target groups for vaccination and implications of infection control measurement.We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have significant reservations, as outlined above.",30,12,2016,2016-12-30,PMC5218551,Research Article,28066826,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10284.2,Quantification and determinants of the amount of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shed using real time PCR data from a longitudinal household study.,2016-12-14,research-article; journal article; 
NA,NA,Wathuo,Miriam,NA,"KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya",NA,"1.

This is a major limitation as samples are taken only every 3-4 days and amounts of shed virus are therefore modelled based on little data and many assumptions, which may or may not equal out. The authors should definitely include more information on how their semi-quantitative data was calibrated.We agree the sampling interval was not optimal for this type of analysis. However, it was not logistically possible to collect deep nasopharyngeal swabs from ~500 participants at a more intense frequency for six months. Furthermore, community acceptability of more frequent sampling was an important issue. The following rationale was used to determine the twice-weekly (every 3.5 days) nasal sampling frequency. Assuming individuals shed virus with mean duration of between 3.5 and 9 days, with a constant rate of recovery from shedding, and an onset on average half way between any sampling interval, then the proportion of individuals predicted to remain shedding, and thus detectable, will range from 61%-82% (for 3.5-9 days duration) for a 3.5 day sampling interval. Given the need to detect infection in mild cases and in older children and adults with a likely lower range of shedding duration, sampling twice weekly was indicated.  2. As authors didn’t use qPCR and use of a standard curve is not described, authors should clarify how they ensured PCR efficiency was stable between runs and what was used to calibrate runs and Ct values. This is a crucial thing to add, as all results in this paper are based on (semi) quantitative measurements and therefore, proper quantification is absolutely key.This is a retrospective analysis of household RSV infection data and we share the referee’s concerns about limitations on the use of Ct values. A qPCR would have been the best method to quantify viral load. However, a standardized multiplex RT-PCR protocol was used which included positive controls monitored each run to ensure their Ct values did not vary significantly.    3. At the beginning of the Methods section, the authors specified that the AUC was calculated using viral load in log scale, but later for the midpoint AUC, they used Ct-value, please clarify.Viral load for calculation of minimum, midpoint and maximum AUC was presented in log
10 copies. Ct values are mentioned to explain how viral load for days in between collection days was estimated before being converted to log
10 copies. The original viral load values were in Ct values, which were then converted to log
10 copies and used to calculate AUC in all three scenarios (minimum, midpoint and maximum AUC).

 4. Reference 21 and 23 are not accessibleThank you. We have rectified the errors in the two references. Reference 21 should be: ‘Kreide, Donald; Lahr D. Trapezoid Rule and Simpson’s Rule [Internet]. 2010. Available from: https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m3cod/klbookLectures/406unit/trap.pdf’,  while reference 23 is the study dataset. 5. Without baseline demographics about the sampled cohort, I find some of this information hard to interpret. Symptomatic infections would also be interesting to see by age group.We have provided a brief summary of the baseline characteristics in the first paragraph of the results section. However, more details could be accessed in our earlier publications arising from this study whose references are provided. Figure 4 of this manuscript provides distribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections by age. 6.  In Table 1, it is not clear how the total AUC was calculated. Surprisingly, the number of RSV infection episodes in the young age group (less than 1 year old and less than 5 years old) is much lower (denominator?) than those in the age group of 5-15 years old, while many epidemiological data have shown the re-infection rates are higher in the young age group. There is no comment/discussion on this result.Total AUC is the cumulative AUC for all infection episodes in a specified category eg age group. The higher number of infection episodes in the 5-15 year age group is most likely due to the higher number of individuals in this age category 
, and this translated to the higher total of the amount of virus shed by this age group. To compare the transmission potential per person by age group, an average amount of virus shed per infection episode might be a better statistic rather than the total AUC 
. However, from the perspective of contribution to community transmission then the cumulative AUC seems appropriate. 
 7. In addition, the number of RSV infection episodes and the AUC in “living with smokers” group were lower and similar, respectively, compared to those who do not live with smokers. This result is controversial with the common observations from many epidemiological studies on RSV susceptibility and there is no comment/discussion regarding this.In this rural community, indoor smoke from solid fuels (mainly firewood and charcoal) was ubiquitous and likely to conceal any effects of smoke from cigarettes. In addition, we only had 18 smokers out of the 493 participants. So, relatively few people lived with smokers. Also, we cannot be sure how much contact members of a household had with a smoker and if the smoker did smoke in the house or outside. A comment has been added in the discussion to that effect. Specific minor comments:  1. P3c1p2: The comparison with human volunteer studies to suggest load / inoculum may be associated with infection is not very strong, this may only be true in the background of a well-developed immune history against RSV whereas the main burden of disease of RSV is in infants who will not have this history yet.This limitation in extrapolating results on association of infection acquisition and exposure and viral load from human challenge studies has been noted and discussed in the main text.  2. P3c1p3: I don’t think excretion is proper terminology for the process of virus shedding (nor is viral density – which is used later on, p6)Well noted. We have now used viral shedding consistently in the text. 3. P3c1p4: the number of sampled household members and the inclusion criteria should be added here.This has been described in a previous paper as stated in the methods section 4. P3c2p1: why were only adeno, corona and rhino targeted with the diagnostic PCR and not the influenzas, parainfluenzas and hMPV? This is a very limited definition of co-infection.Adeno, corona and rhino were the common respiratory viruses detected in a preliminary screening of the samples from 5 randomly selected households and taken forward for the screening of rest of the samples from the remaining households. We thus have limited data to comment on the other respiratory pathogens. 5. P6: Please clarify why data are presented as median (IQR) amounts of virus shed in one paragraph but then as mean amounts (95%CI) of virus shed in the otherThe AUC values were still slightly skewed even after log transformation. So, we presented medians in the descriptive analysis because it is the best measure for a skewed variable. However, the linear regression analysis coefficients are means not medians, so for the linear regression results, we had to present means and 95% CI.  6. P8c1p2: In Table 2 sex is not significant, but its mentioned here as an associated factorWe chose to adjust for sex a priori because sex has previously been considered an important risk factor to RSV infections. In the final model presented sex was not a significant covariate though. 7. P8c2p3: the result that timing within the season was (appeared?) associated with the amount of virus shed is presented in the discussion section, shouldn’t this also be presented as a result, with data and a p-value?This was a comparison of viral load values (not amount of virus) against time just to show the reader a visual of how viral load varied depending on the month of the year. This was to demonstrate that there is an increase in the number of positive viral load detections during the RSV season. This has been mentioned in the results and discussion sections. 8. P8c2p3: why is it of particular importance that 90.3% of virus shed is from individuals experiencing their first episode? Also, 179/208 episodes studied were first episodesFirst episode in this case refers to the first infection detected over the study period, which were 179 (86%). As stated earlier, the total AUC gives an idea of which groups contribute most to community transmission of virus. It is, therefore, important to note that most virus shed comes from individuals experiencing their first episode of the RSV season. 9.

Please comment on the choice of log viral load in analysesThe absolute values (viral RNA copy numbers) for AUC were not normally distributed and were log transformed to stabilize the variances providing a suitable outcome variable for use in linear regression analysis.

The choice of outcome has been clarified in the manuscript.We have re-analysed the data by the alternative route of summing the absolute viral load values and then taking logs to estimate the AUC. The results are not substantially different from the current method which is a summation of the log-transformed values to estimate AUC. This is stated in the discussion. 2.

It seems as if you are calculating the AUC based on log_10 viral copies but what is the biological interpretation of that? I was wondering whether the number of viruses could be a better correlate of transmission, not their log? The relationship between viral shedding and infectiousness is unknown. The relationship between amount of virus shed and risk of infection might be linear or have a threshold effect (e.g. minimum dose), in which case a logarithmic scale would be more appropriate. The log-transformation allowed us to stabilize the variance of the outcome values, suggesting that the measurement error of amount of virus might vary non-linearly. The final conclusions (biological interpretation of determinants of amount of virus spread) is similar to when using the arithmetic values since an increase in log values is also linked to an increase in absolute values albeit at exponential scale. The relationship between various factors such as age, symptoms, etc and untransformed amount of virus is the same as that between those factors and the log-transformed amount of virus. Using log-transformed values does not affect the final conclusions. Determining the relationship between measures of virus shed and risk of transmission requires a different analysis which we are undertaking.

A caveat lies in the fact that the two sources of variation can not necessarily be distinguished in a straight-forward manner, and that analyses of allele specific expression might be hampered by biases in mapping and variant calling. mRNA-levels vary by many orders of magnitude, so in order to detect variants in lowly expressed genes, the detection method has to be precise and sensitive in regions covered by only a few reads. Taking this into account and with the focus being restricted to expressed regions of the genome, RNA-Seq is a cost-effective alternative to whole genome sequencing. A tool that helps improving the process, by increasing precision, sensitivity and processing speed would be useful and, indeed, would make the most out of RNA-Seq. The authors show that Opossum meets these demands. Rather than being a variant caller itself, Opossum is basically a preprocessing pipeline to make RNA-seq reads better suited for variant calling than the original raw data. The process executed by Opossum includes:
Quality control and removal of spuriously mapped read-pairs.Duplicate removal and solving of variant calling conflicts between read duplicates.Merging of overlapping reads.Splitting of intron-spanning reads.Flagging of first N and last M bases to be ignored. This is described in the manuscript in a clear and comprehensive manner. The authors show that there is a marked increase in sensitivity using the combination of Opossum and Platypus, compared to the GATK Best Practices Pipeline. Likewise, computation time is significantly reduced. This supports the claim that Opossum is a useful tool for variant calling of RNA-Seq data. There are a couple of points that remain to be addressed, though:
Opossum is a python script, so installation is not a problem. However, it uses samtools sort, and there is an incompatibility with samtools versions. The samtools version used to test the software (1.2) requires a file prefix for temporary files to be stated, which the Opossum code fails to do, causing an error. This should be fixed or at least the dependencies should be stated clearly.It remains unexplained how much of the described improvement of sensitivity is due to Opossum processing or to Platypus variant calling (compared to GATK). We are only presented results with Opossum and Platypus in combination. Is it possible to use Platypus on RNA-seq data at all without the Opossum step? This is not discussed in the manuscript. The authors should make that point clearer.As a minor remark, the sentence in the last paragraph ""Having validated the capability of Opossum to detect SNPs"" is not entirely accurate, since Opossum itself does not do the variant calling. In conclusion, Opossum is a tool that is useful for a specific task in the variant calling process of RNA-Seq data. The Opossum/Platypus combination results in an increased sensitivity and reduced computation time compared to the GATK Best Practices pipeline.

The study design as outlined in the Methods section is clear and concise, as is the Results section. The results encouragingly indicate that there has been a reduction in the use of the word “commit” in the three main suicide-specific journals but that there is still more work to do to ensure the stigma associated with suicide is not added to. The authors indicate that they hope their study will act as a catalyst for discussion and further consideration of the words that we use, and the ways in which we say things. This is a worthy goal as a simple switch of one word to another could eradicate any connotations of criminality, shame or sin, thus destigmatising the deceased as well as those bereaved by suicide. The authors’ suggestion that editors and reviewers could play an important role in encouraging the use of more appropriate language is a good one. I hope that this is something they have, or intend to pursue directly with the Editor-in-Chiefs of the journals that form the basis of this study (at a minimum). A few minor points to consider:
 “In academic literatures there is a precedent for demanding considered language…” – the word ‘demanding’ seems too strong in this context.Aim 1 – seems a little redundant given Aim 2“In 2015 one in eight articles still used this outdated, largely inaccurate and stigmatised phrase” – is it possible to consider this phrase truly outdated if we are still using measures that use the phrase?

During the mitotic cell cycle, a rigorous licensing mechanism that involves phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the centrosome components restricts the number of centrosome duplications to exactly one per cell cycle. Physiological importance of this regulation is underlined by the fact that tumour cells are often associated with abnormally amplified centrosomes. The timing of the centrosome duplication in many organisms coincides with S phase, where DNA replication takes place. Common cell cycle regulators, such as CDKs, trigger both centrosome duplication and DNA replication events. In meiosis, however, centrosome duplication must be uncoupled from DNA replication, because, no DNA replication must occur at the transition from meiosis I (MI) to meiosis II (MII). Although the mechanism of uncoupling of the centrosomal and DNA replication cycles in meiosis is mostly unclear, studies in
Xenopus oocytes
1 and the fission yeast
2 found significant residual CDK activities at MI - MII transition, suggesting that these CDK activities may inhibit DNA replication, hence, decoupling the centrosome cycle from the DNA replication cycle. However, further supporting evidence for it or the molecular basis that directs the meiotic centrosome cycle has still been missing. In this manuscript, Fox
et al
3 used the budding yeast as a model and showed that Cdc14 phosphatase is one of the essential regulators of the meiotic centrosome duplication. By exploiting a conditional
cdc14-1 mutant, an absolute requirement of Cdc14 function in meiotic centrosome duplication was clearly demonstrated through extensive live and fixed cell imaging of the cells undergoing MI-MII synchronously. Observation using electron microscopy provided further supporting evidence.   The manuscript is very well written, the quality of the data (which are mostly very clearly presented) is high and sound data interpretations have been provided. Therefore, I would like to approve this study. A few minor points are listed below to help further clarify the authors’ message.  
Culturing condition to inactivate Cdc14: It was not too clear which temperature (and how long) was used to inactivate Cdc14 in the
cdc14-1 ts mutant. Or, does
cdc14-1 mutant show its meiotic phenotype at an intermediate temperature 30
oC? It would be really helpful if the authors would clarify this point.Fig. 3D and 3E: In these figures, the Cdc14-GFP signal at the SPB is presented. If I understood correctly, in the pCLB2-3HA-CDC55 setting, SPB duplication does not occur and only one SPB can be found in each cell. If this would be the case, it would be helpful to clearly state so, thus, “asymmetric Cdc14 localisation” is not relevant in this experimental setting.Page 8 final paragraph: “…but

In the “Metaphase II” panel, it would be helpful to have additional small arrowheads in order to indicate SPBs (Spc42-CFP signal-positive dots) without Bfa1-tdTomato signal, so that asymmetric Bfa1-tdTomato localization is easily recognisable.Page 12, 2
nd paragraph: It would be helpful to dub the SPB as “Spc42-tdTomato foci” in this paragraph. For example, instead of saying “two SPB” or “four SPB”, say “two Spc42-tdTomato foci” or “Four Spc42-tdTomato foci”. This is because until we see Fig. 7 and 8, we do not know whether a “Spc42-tdTomato focus” represents a non-duplicated SPB (I would call this one SPB) or non-separated SPBs (I would call this two SPBs).Figure 7, figure legends: Legends corresponding to panels (A-E) contain some inconsistencies, i.e., legends to panel (B) and (E) are missing, and C, D, and E are wrongly assigned.

We used 30C, which we believe is efficient at largely inactivating Cdc14 (see comments to other reviewers) as vegetative cells fail to grow at this temperature. We have added this information to the methods.

Previous work had shown that the Cdc14 phosphatase must be properly controlled to permit assembly of two MII spindles through an unknown mechanism. In addition, the SPB half-bridge protein Sfi1 has been recently identified as a critical target of Cdc14 in mitosis in order to license SPB duplication. In this manuscript the authors show that Cdc14 associates with SPBs also in meiosis. Cdc14 localization at SPBs is asymmetric and requires the Bub2/Bfa1 complex. Cdc14, while not being strictly required for exit from MI (i.e. spindle disassembly), is required for SPB duplication and proper nuclear division in MII. Conversely, premature Cdc14 activation in cells lacking Cdc55 prevents SPB separation in MI. Finally, although SPBs do not duplicate upon Cdc14 inactivation, composition of the SPB remains mostly unchanged. Overall, experiments are carefully executed and conclusions are mostly supported by the experimental data. I have, however, a couple of main issues and a few minor points that the authors might want to address. Main points:  
The incubation of
cdc14-1 mutant cells at 30°C, which might be a semi-permissive temperature, raises the question as to what extent Cdc14 is actually inactivated in these cells. Wouldn’t it have been better to use a tighter system to inactivate Cdc14 (e.g. expressing
CDC14 from the
CLB2 promoter) ? It is even possible that the Cdc14-1 protein is prematurely released, thereby tempering the effects of temperature inactivation. Has nucleolar release of the Cdc14-1 protein ever been checked at 25°C/30°C ? This would also be relevant to interpret correctly the data in Fig. 1B and C, where
cdc14-1 cells do not behave exactly like FEAR mutants.Quantification of SPB signals during meiotic progression (Fig. 7A-E) is an essential piece of data to support the conclusion that
cdc14-1 cells are defective in SPB duplication upon entry into MII. I wonder if a slow-folding fluorescent protein, such as Spc42-tdTomato, is actually a suitable marker for this kind of analyses. A related issue concerns the way these data are presented, which I find a bit confusing. For instance, I do not understand why there are gaps in the plot of wild type cells at 0.75-1h and 1.5-1.75h (Fig. 7C), since fluorescence intensities are measured on movies. Direct inspection of SPBs by EM, like the authors did, should greatly help understanding what is going on in the
cdc14-1 mutant. However, knowing how many MII cells display the phenotype shown in Fig. 8A is an essential piece of information that is currently missing. Another interesting information is whether SPB over-duplication was ever found in
pCLB2-CDC55 cells. Finally, if it were possible to inactivate Cdc14 before commitment to meiosis, would the authors expect a defect in SPB duplication also in MI? The likely possibility that Cdc14 is a crucial licensing factor in ALL kinds of divisions should perhaps be mentioned in the discussion.Since the role of Cdc14 in licensing SPB duplication in mitosis has been linked to Sfi1 dephosphorylation, it would have been nice to check the phosphorylation state of Sfi1 in wild type and
cdc14-1 cells during meiosis. This kind of information might even be extracted from the mass spec data from Fig. 7F. Along the same line, it would have been interesting to check if the published unphosphorylatable
sfi1 mutant can suppress the SPB duplication defect of
cdc14-1 cells. This would have offered strong experimental support to the model presented in Fig. 9.   Minor points  
It is unclear why in the movies of
cdc14-1 cells (Fig. 1) spindles do not reassemble in the second meiotic division from the two unduplicated SPBs (like for example in Fig. 8A). The abnormal spindle behaviour reported in Fig. 1C is not commented in the text. Surprisingly,
cdc14-1 have a milder phenotype than FEAR mutants in this respect, although
cdc14-1 has a more pronounced defect in spindle disassembly.It is not clear why Spo21 is in the list of Tap-Cdc14 interacting proteins with 0 peptides identified.Cdc14 is reported to localize at SPBs in most
pCLB2-CDC55 cells where Cdc14 is partially or completely released from nucleolus. Yet, in the example cell #2 of Fig. 3D Cdc14 is not visible on the SPB. A better representative image could be selected.Graphs in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 look pixeled.In Fig. 7C there is a label within the graph that belongs to the IPs underneath. Also, the graphs (C, D, E) are mislabeled relative to the legend.In Fig. 7F two prominent bands appear in the Spc42-Flag IP from wt cells, while one of the two is much decreased in
cdc14-1 cells. Which one of the two is Spc42?

cdc14-1 cells do not behave exactly like FEAR mutants.
Please see response to comment by Soni Lacefield. We agree we cannot completely rule out partial inactivation of Cdc14.
Quantification of SPB signals during meiotic progression (Fig. 7A-E) is an essential piece of data to support the conclusion that 
cdc14-1 cells are defective in SPB duplication upon entry into MII. I wonder if a slow-folding fluorescent protein, such as Spc42-tdTomato, is actually a suitable marker for this kind of analyses.
Because of these and other concerns (see response to Soni Lacefield) we used EM as a completely independent way to examine SPB duplication in cdc14-1 mutants. We believe the EM data provides convincing evidence for our conclusions, while the fluorescence intensity measurements provide some supporting data.
 A related issue concerns the way these data are presented, which I find a bit confusing. For instance, I do not understand why there are gaps in the plot of wild type cells at 0.75-1h and 1.5-1.75h (Fig. 7C), since fluorescence intensities are measured on movies.The data for individual cells was lined up so that the 1h timepoint is defined as the point at which 2 SPBs are first observed. The different coloured lines represent 1, 2 or 4 SPBs. We have clarified this point in the figure legend. Direct inspection of SPBs by EM, like the authors did, should greatly help understanding what is going on in the 
cdc14-1 mutant. However, knowing how many MII cells display the phenotype shown in Fig. 8A is an essential piece of information that is currently missing. Another interesting information is whether SPB over-duplication was ever found in 
pCLB2-CDC55 cells.Overall we observed SPBs in 8 cdc14-1 cells by EM. Out of these, evidence of late meiosis II events (i.e. spore formation/vesicles) was observed in 3 of these. The image shown in Figure 8A is one example of two in which a spindle could be followed between 2SPBs. The other example was spread over >8 sections (spore formation undetermined) so the image shown was favoured. The third example showed the spore wall forming around a nucleus so SPBs were not connected by spindles in that case.No evidence of overduplication of SPBs was observed in pCLB2-CDC55 cells (n=6).We have included this information in the relevant section in the paper. All EM images are available here: https://osf.io/g5cmh/ (
Marston, 2016). Finally, if it were possible to inactivate Cdc14 before commitment to meiosis, would the authors expect a defect in SPB duplication also in MI? The likely possibility that Cdc14 is a crucial licensing factor in ALL kinds of divisions should perhaps be mentioned in the discussion.The licensing event that enables SPB duplication during meiosis I would be expected to occur in the last stages of vegetative growth i.e. at mitotic exit prior to commitment to meiosis. So yes, it would be required in the same way that Cdc14 is required to license SPBs during vegetative growth. 2.. Since the role of Cdc14 in licensing SPB duplication in mitosis has been linked to Sfi1 dephosphorylation, it would have been nice to check the phosphorylation state of Sfi1 in wild type and 
cdc14-1 cells during meiosis. This kind of information might even be extracted from the mass spec data from Fig. 7F.Unfortunately we did not detect Sfi1 phosphorylation in our quantitative mass spec analysis. We attempted to examine Sfi1 phosphorylation on western blots and phostag gels but since the time period where Sfi1 dephosphorylation is expected to be observed (anaphase I) is very short, we were unable to obtain sufficient time resolution to make firm conclusions about the effect of Cdc14 inactivation of Sfi1 phosphorylation status. 3. Along the same line, it would have been interesting to check if the published unphosphorylatable 
sfi1 mutant can suppress the SPB duplication defect of 
cdc14-1 cells. This would have offered strong experimental support to the model presented in Fig. 9.We agree that this would be a very interesting experiment but despite extensive efforts we were unable to generate yeast strains carrying the Sfi1 phosphonull mutants and were therefore sadly unable to do this experiment. Diploid cells carrying the mutations as the sole copy of Sfi1 were extremely sick and would not enter meiosis. Other approaches were also attempted, for example expression of Sfi1 only in meiosis but due to both biological and technical reasons we have so far been unable to address this important point. Minor points  
It is unclear why in the movies of 
cdc14-1 cells (Fig. 1) spindles do not reassemble in the second meiotic division from the two unduplicated SPBs (like for example in Fig. 8A).
For reasons we do not understand, spindles reassemble in a fraction of cdc14-1 cells, depending on the growth condition. In live cell imaging (Fig. 1), about 10% of cells were observed to reassemble spindles, however, the fraction is likely to be higher in flasks (Fig. 8A).
 The abnormal spindle behaviour reported in Fig. 1C is not commented in the text. Surprisingly, 
cdc14-1 have a milder phenotype than FEAR mutants in this respect, although 
cdc14-1 has a more pronounced defect in spindle disassembly.We have included a sentence raising this point in the results section. 2. It is not clear why Spo21 is in the list of Tap-Cdc14 interacting proteins with 0 peptides identified.For completeness, all SPB proteins were included in the list, regardless of whether they were identified in the mass spectrometer. 3. Cdc14 is reported to localize at SPBs in most 
pCLB2-CDC55 cells where Cdc14 is partially or completely released from nucleolus. Yet, in the example cell #2 of Fig. 3D Cdc14 is not visible on the SPB. A better representative image could be selected.Cell #3 shows a cell where Cdc14 is on the SPB. Cell #2 is an example of where the diffuse released Cdc14 signal overlaps with the SPB. As these are the criteria that were scored, these examples are appropriate. 4. Graphs in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 look pixeled.  
We have uploaded new versions of these figures that should correct this problem.
 5. In Fig. 7C there is a label within the graph that belongs to the IPs underneath. Also, the graphs (C, D, E) are mislabeled relative to the legend.We have corrected this. 6. In Fig. 7F two prominent bands appear in the Spc42-Flag IP from wt cells, while one of the two is much decreased in 
cdc14-1 cells.

et al. demonstrate that Cdc14, a key phosphatase that promotes CDK inactivation and exit from mitosis in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also plays a pivotal role in promoting the re-licensing of the SPBs at the meiosis I to meiosis II transition, thus ensuring the re-duplication of these structures between these two different meiotic phases. In order to fulfill this function, Cdc14 is loaded on a single SPB during anaphase I in a process that depends on the Bfa1/Bub2 complex. Once loaded on the SPB, Cdc14 likely promotes dephosphorylation of key substrates on this structure, thereby allowing the re-duplication of the SPBs in meiosis II. This newly suggested meiotic function of Cdc14 helps to shed light on how cells establish the particular pattern of chromosome segregation during meiosis, an essential cell division process by which gametes are generated. Overall, the experiments detailed in the manuscript are carefully designed, nicely presented and well executed. Also, and importantly, the final conclusions of the manuscript are properly sustained by the provided experimental data. Therefore, I support an approved status for this article. In any case, I also indicate some minor corrections that would need to be introduced, as well as some suggestions that might help the authors to improve the manuscript and strengthen some of the conclusions:  
In page 8, when the authors indicate that
slk19∆ and
spo12∆ cells disassembled anaphase I spindles with a timing comparable to wild type cells, they only refer to Figure 1B, but Figure 1A should be also mentioned. Additionally, and regarding the data in Figure 1A, I would suggest to show images for other live cell experiments that are more representative of the previous statement. Although Figure 1B indeed shows that, as an average, time from anaphase I onset until spindle disassembly is similar for wild type,
slk19∆ and
spo12∆ cells, in the images shown in Figure 1A for the
slk19∆ and
spo12∆ cells the spindle disassembles, respectively, 20 min and 30 min after anaphase I onset, which is significantly earlier than for the wild type (40 min).Also in page 8, it is later stated that “[…] the two component GAP Bfa1/Bfa1, […] localizes symmetrically at SPBs during metaphase I, anaphase I but symmetrically during metaphase II”. This sentence should be corrected, since, as shown in Figure 1B, Bfa1 localization is asymmetric during metaphase II.The localization of Cdc14-GFP is difficult to assess in Figure 3A, due to the nucleolar background and the appearance of other GFP foci that do not co-localize with the SPBs and whose nature it is not indicated (
e.g., 1:15 time point in Figure 3A). Since the authors show different proteins that interact with Cdc14 on the SPBs, they might consider to use a different approach if they plan to further analyze this localization in the future. As such, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC)
1 could be helpful to determine the exact timing and pattern of localization of Cdc14 on the SPBs. The BiFC assay could facilitate tracking Cdc14 localization exclusively to the SPBs by means of the reconstitution of a fluorescent signal when the phosphatase and a SPB component, both tagged with different fragments of a fluorescent protein, interact.In page 16, when the authors show a 1.5-fold increase in Spc42-tdTomato intensity as wild type cells progressed from G1 into prophase I, they only refer to Figure 7A, but it is in Figure 7B where the quantification is shown.A shocking observation is that, despite Bfa1/Bub2 being symmetrically localized in anaphase I and Cdc14 activity being presumably required at both SPBs to trigger their duplication in meiosis II, the phosphatase is asymmetrically localized to only one SPB during anaphase I. This is an obvious caveat and, although I do appreciate that it would require further extensive analysis for this question to be solved, the authors might have speculated a little more extensively about the reasons for this asymmetry in the discussion of the manuscript.A prediction of the model proposed by Fox
et al. is that re-duplication of the SPBs should be restored in a
cdc14-1 mutant background by conditionally forcing Cdc14 loading on the SPBs at the appropriate time (
e.g., by temporarily expressing a fusion between Cdc14 and a SPB component). This is a relatively straightforward experiment that the authors might consider to carry out at some point to further strengthen their model.

slk19∆ and 
spo12∆ cells disassembled anaphase I spindles with a timing comparable to wild type cells, they only refer to Figure 1B, but Figure 1A should be also mentioned. Additionally, and regarding the data in Figure 1A, I would suggest to show images for other live cell experiments that are more representative of the previous statement. Although Figure 1B indeed shows that, as an average, time from anaphase I onset until spindle disassembly is similar for wild type, 
slk19∆ and 
spo12∆ cells, in the images shown in Figure 1A for the 
slk19∆ and 
spo12∆ cells the spindle disassembles, respectively, 20 min and 30 min after anaphase I onset, which is significantly earlier than for the wild type (40 min).We have now included the reference to Figure 1A. Under the conditions we observed them, the timing of spindle disassembly varied across all strains (Figure 1B)
, we tried to show representative images to reflect this. 2. Also in page 8, it is later stated that “[…] the two component GAP Bfa1/Bfa1, […] localizes symmetrically at SPBs during metaphase I, anaphase I but symmetrically during metaphase II”. This sentence should be corrected, since, as shown in Figure 1B, Bfa1 localization is asymmetric during metaphase II.The typo has been corrected. 3. The localization of Cdc14-GFP is difficult to assess in Figure 3A, due to the nucleolar background and the appearance of other GFP foci that do not co-localize with the SPBs and whose nature it is not indicated (
e.g., 1:15 time point in Figure 3A). Since the authors show different proteins that interact with Cdc14 on the SPBs, they might consider to use a different approach if they plan to further analyze this localization in the future. As such, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC)
1 could be helpful to determine the exact timing and pattern of localization of Cdc14 on the SPBs. The BiFC assay could facilitate tracking Cdc14 localization exclusively to the SPBs by means of the reconstitution of a fluorescent signal when the phosphatase and a SPB component, both tagged with different fragments of a fluorescent protein, interact.It is presently unclear what the non-nucleolar, non-SPB Cdc14-GFP foci represent. Although outside the scope of the current manuscript, we appreciate the excellent suggestion to use a bimolecular complementation assay to probe the co-localization of Cdc14 with SPBs. It would be particularly interesting to determine whether Cdc14 can be detected at both SPBs using this system. 4. In page 16, when the authors show a 1.5-fold increase in Spc42-tdTomato intensity as wild type cells progressed from G1 into prophase I, they only refer to Figure 7A, but it is in Figure 7B where the quantification is shown.This has been corrected. 5. A shocking observation is that, despite Bfa1/Bub2 being symmetrically localized in anaphase I and Cdc14 activity being presumably required at both SPBs to trigger their duplication in meiosis II, the phosphatase is asymmetrically localized to only one SPB during anaphase I. This is an obvious caveat and, although I do appreciate that it would require further extensive analysis for this question to be solved, the authors might have speculated a little more extensively about the reasons for this asymmetry in the discussion of the manuscript.We agree, this is indeed a surprising finding that remains unexplained. We expanded our discussion as suggested, though ultimately this is indeed a very puzzling observation for which we currently do not have an explanation. 6. A prediction of the model proposed by Fox 
et al. is that re-duplication of the SPBs should be restored in a 
cdc14-1 mutant background by conditionally forcing Cdc14 loading on the SPBs at the appropriate time (
e.g., by temporarily expressing a fusion between Cdc14 and a SPB component). This is a relatively straightforward experiment that the authors might consider to carry out at some point to further strengthen their model. Furthermore, and coming back to the differential localization of Cdc14 on the SPBs during anaphase I, this experiment could be informative to address the importance of this asymmetry in future studies. Cdc14 could be fused either to Bfa1 (asymmetrically localized) or an integral SPB component (symmetrically localized), and then analyze the consequences of expressing both Cdc14 fusions during meiosis.We attempted this experiment using the GFP-GBP system. However, we were unable to obtain strains in which Cdc14 and SPB components were both tagged with these binding partners. Although other explanations are possible, these findings are consistent with the idea that forced constitutive targeting of Cdc14 to the SPB is lethal also in vegetative cells. Due to the lethality we were unfortunately unable to assess the effect on meiosis.",11,2,2017,2017-2-11,PMC5266553,Research Article,28133632,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10507.2,Cdc14 phosphatase directs centrosome re-duplication at the meiosis I to meiosis II transition in budding yeast.,2017-01-05,research-article; journal article;

During this transition, cells must disassemble the meiosis I spindle, duplicate their spindle poles, and undergo a second round of spindle assembly without re-replicating their DNA.  Previous work established that Cdc14 is  important for this transition because cells lacking Cdc14 only formed one spindle, but it's role had not been characterized. This work uses a combination of fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and proteomics to demonstrate  that Cdc14 SPB localization is required for the re-licensing of SPBs in the meiosis I to meiosis II transition. Furthermore, the proper timing of Cdc14 is also important, as premature Cdc14 activity results in a failure of SPBs to separate.  Overall, this is an important study that identifies a novel role for Cdc14 and increases our understanding of how SPBs duplicate between the two divisions. However, there are some points that need addressed: Major considerations:
Does the Cdc14-1 allele result in a complete loss of function in meiosis? A discussion of whether this is a hypomorph or complete loss of function would be helpful, especially for thinking about the conclusion that ""Cdc14 is not absolutely required for CDK down-regulation at meiosis I exit"".In Figure 1 C, why do only 50% of the cells form 2 spindles instead of all of the cells? The duration of the movies needs to be increased to ensure that there is enough time for meiosis II to occur.I am having difficulty reconciling the results in Fig 7 with the model in Fig. 9. Why does the Spc42 fluorescence remain the same throughout meiosis I (metaphase I and anaphase I) when the SPB should be duplicating during the time? It would be helpful to have a graph showing the change in Spc42 fluorescence, tracking individual cells, also marking the time of anaphase I and anaphase II.Does Sfi1 phosphorylation change throughout meiosis? Does Sfi1 remain phosphorylated in the Cdc14-1 cells?A thought about the conclusions: The prematurely released Cdc14 in pCLB2-CDC55 cells also localized to SPBs but does not allow SPBs reduplication. Does this finding suggest that the Cdc14 SPB localization is required but not sufficient to promote SPB duplication if the SPBs have not first separated?      Minor points:
The last sentence in the abstract should end in ""meiosis II transition."" It currently says meiosis I.The sentence in the last paragraph on page 8 should read, ""An exception is the two component GAP Bub2/Bfa1 which localized symmetrically at SPBs during metaphase I, anaphase I by asymmetrically during metaphase II"".The reference to the white arrow in Figure 8 is right after talking about vesicle formation, but the arrow does not point at the vesicles.On page 16, the reference to Fig. 7F is missing and one of the references to 7E should be to 7G.

NA,NA,Marston,Adele,NA,"University of Edinburgh, UK",NA,"We are grateful for your approval in principle and constructive comments. Here we address your reservations.  Major considerations: 1. Does the Cdc14-1 allele result in a complete loss of function in meiosis? A discussion of whether this is a hypomorph or complete loss of function would be helpful, especially for thinking about the conclusion that ""Cdc14 is not absolutely required for CDK down-regulation at meiosis I exit"".It is true that we cannot be sure that the cdc14-1 allele is completely inactivated during meiosis. Our attempts to deplete or degrade Cdc14 during meiosis have been unsuccessful and therefore temperature-sensitive alleles are the best tools we have. We find that spindle disassembly is impaired in cdc14-1 conditions in mitosis but not meiosis under similar temperature conditions, leading us to suggest a lesser requirement for Cdc14 in meiotic spindle disassembly. Recently, similar findings have been reported for meiosis II using a different temperature sensitive allele (Argüello-Miranda
et al., 2017).
We have revised the text to include the possibility that Cdc14 retains partial function using these alleles and included a reference to this recent study. 2. In Figure 1 C, why do only 50% of the cells form 2 spindles instead of all of the cells? The duration of the movies needs to be increased to ensure that there is enough time for meiosis II to occur.The duration of the movies was 12h, however not all cells complete meiosis under the imaging conditions used for this experiment. Rather than bias the data by scoring only cells that complete meiosis II, all cells that enter meiosis were included in the analysis. This experiment was performed at a time where we were still establishing optimal conditions for live cell imaging of cells undergoing meiosis. Although we recognise that we could improve on this with our optimised conditions (where essentially all cells complete meiosis), we feel that the data presented clearly shows the effect of different mutants on meiosis I spindle disassembly.   3. I am having difficulty reconciling the results in Fig 7 with the model in Fig. 9. Why does the Spc42 fluorescence remain the same throughout meiosis I (metaphase I and anaphase I) when the SPB should be duplicating during the time? It would be helpful to have a graph showing the change in Spc42 fluorescence, tracking individual cells, also marking the time of anaphase I and anaphase II.SPB fluorescence stays the same throughout meiosis I (metaphase I and anaphase I) because SPBs are already duplicated before metaphase I (i.e. in the ndt80D arrest – see Figure 7C). We do note, however, that a greater increase in fluorescence might be expected during the later stages of anaphase I in wild type cells. The source data for this experiment that would allow the reader to make traces of individual cells is available at https://osf.io/g5cmh/ (
Marston, 2016).
The fluorescence analysis of Spc42-tdTomato is complicated by two factors that mean we cannot make stand alone conclusions from it. First, in other experiments (not shown) we concluded that Spc42 incorporation into the SPB is continuous and exchange occurs. Second, the SPB undergoes a remodelling and maturation during meiosis II. As a result of these concerns we performed electron microscopy, which clearly show a failure in SPB re-duplication in cdc14-1
mutants. 
We believe that the EM data unequivocally supports our conclusions, while the fluorescence intensity data offer supportive, but not definitive evidence.
 2. Does Sfi1 phosphorylation change throughout meiosis? Does Sfi1 remain phosphorylated in the Cdc14-1 cells?Despite extensive efforts to examine Sfi1 phosphorylation in wild type and cdc14-1 mutants undergoing meiosis, the findings were inconclusive. Judging by the presence of multiple Sfi1 species on western blots, Sfi1 appears to be extensively phosphorylated during meiosis in wild type cells. Our model predicts transient dephosphorylation at the time of anaphase I, while phosphorylation should persist in cdc14-1 mutants. Unfortunately, using this method, we were unable to reproducibly visualize Sfi1 dephosphorylation during anaphase I during wild type cells, likely due to the very short time window in which it occurs and variable cell synchronization, even using the best methods currently available (NDT80 block-release). 3. A thought about the conclusions: The prematurely released Cdc14 in
pCLB2-CDC55 cells also localized to SPBs but does not allow SPBs reduplication. Does this finding suggest that the Cdc14 SPB localization is required but not sufficient to promote SPB duplication if the SPBs have not first separated?SPBs undergo the first round of duplication in pCLB2-CDC55 cells but do not appear to be able to separate. The licensing model predicts that, following Cdc14 dephosphorylation of Sfi1, CDK activity is required to separate the SPBs. We suggest that Cdc14 at the SPB counteracts CDK activity, thereby preventing separation of SPBs. Therefore, we agree, SPB separation may be a pre-requisite for duplication. Minor points:

It currently says meiosis I.We have corrected this The sentence in the last paragraph on page 8 should read, ""An exception is the two component GAP Bub2/Bfa1 which localized symmetrically at SPBs during metaphase I, anaphase I by asymmetrically during metaphase II"".Corrected.The reference to the white arrow in Figure 8 is right after talking about vesicle formation, but the arrow does not point at the vesicles.

This study of the hospital (now known simply as Erskine Hospital) draws upon the Erskine Collection at Glasgow University to provide a very specific case study which highlights wider issues surrounding disability and rehabilitation. This article is grounded in a very particular time and place but recognises the importance of both the pre-war context and the long-term consequences of the hospital’s work with wartime amputees. World War One was not a
tabula rasa: men had lost limbs in previous wars and in the industrial accidents of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Moreover, centres specialising in the complicated after-care required by the limbless have remained important and current practitioners can learn from this early history. This article makes impressive use of a particular set of archives but also demonstrates the broader hinterland involved in the history of early twentieth-century care for war-wounded men. The role of private charity was paramount but this involved more than simply putting money in a tin or agreeing to an annual donation. Donors were able to inspect the hospital workshops – and their annual accounts – and some donations indicate a highly personal link with the institution and its work. The story of the widow donating her paralysed late-husband’s carving tools is a case in point. Masculinity, and the preservation of masculinity looms large. The empty sleeve or pinned-up trouser-leg denoted a real loss on account of the cultural and economic importance of the limb. As a result disabled men were encouraged to ‘do their bit’, to become economically self-sufficient with the help of prosthetic limbs and to re-enter the appropriately masculine workspace. The intricate connections between the first total war and the industrial complex are especially pertinent here. The men were maimed by the fire-power of modern technology and those same industrial processes then became part of the cure as engineers from the Clydeside shipyards played a crucial role in designing prosthetic limbs. Like all good articles this one poses further questions for research. Why were so many men reluctant to train in the sheltered workshops? The author suggests that hospital regulations and processes played some role in this reluctance but it would be useful to probe further, especially given that one of the purposes of this research is to inform current practice. Nevertheless, this article highlights the economic, cultural and medical practices of the Erskine Hospital in the period of the Great War, and the photographic illustrations are well-selected to allow us a glimpse into the well-ordered and highly-organised attempt to re-create modern masculinity.I have read this submission.

Erskine was the main location for the aftercare of amputation, limb fitting, and vocational therapy for those patients in Scotland. The research makes a contribution to regional studies in the history of medicine in Britain. There is little work done on First World War rehabilitation in regional contexts, so this article compliments the work published mainly on English hospitals. Furthermore, the article offers a unique insight into the programmes in a single hospital, which provides points of comparison between Erskine and other military hospitals around Britain. Anxieties, both civilian and military, which surrounding the fate of the war wounded are addressed in this article. The form of post-war employment and whether suitable training was offered concerned the authorities and the public. The creation of ‘productive’ disabled veterans was central to the rehabilitative process and was bound up with concerns about employable bodies and masculine identity. The article makes a real contribution in its examination of the role of vocational therapy in hospitals during the war. The wounded men were offered new forms of employment which suited their level of impairment. Similar to other hospitals, Erskine was not merely a locus of medical care – its remit was expanded to develop and manage vocational therapies. Training in mechanics and agriculture was undertaken at Erskine, and the public supported the hospital through donations of money and equipment to outfit the workshops, and maintained vital levels of support by buying items produced at the hospital. The article details Erskine’s longevity, supporting the notion that vocational units within hospitals provided a vital role in rehabilitation throughout the twentieth century. The paper makes the important point that policy makers, practitioners, and others currently responsible for disabled veteran’s support should reflect on the successful programmes established at Erskine over 100 years ago. Overall, this paper offers a fascinating insight into a relatively understudied war hospital. It is gratifying to see rich archival sources utilised to provide new and innovative research which assists our knowledge, understanding, and subsequent analysis of the range of therapeutic provision in hospitals in Britain during and after the First World War.I have read this submission.

 et al investigates the role of 12-15-lipoxygenase in B cell phenotype and function using healthy mice deficient in the enzyme (Alox15-/- mice).  They report that in the 12/15-Lox deficient mice there are (i) increased global titres of IgM  as well as increased IgA and IgG in the lung; (ii) increased splenic B cell subsets associated with IgM secretion, but no effect on numbers of peripheral or splenic B cells; (iii) comparable B cell activation thresholds following TLR engagement. The changes in IgM, IgA and IgG were for the most part, very subtle.  While largely descriptive, the work is interesting, well performed and the data is well generally described and interpreted.   The authors conclude that since 12/15-LOX is not expressed by B cells, its expression by other cell types likely leads to regulation of B cell subsets.  The notion that oxidised lipids that can regulate B cell subsets and antibody production (albeit modestly), is interesting.  Although, the work provides no mechanistic insight into how this occurs, the authors do provide some speculative explanation based on published observations from other groups.   Personally, I would of found a schematic of the model being proposed quite helpful in this respect. The B cell activation studies were performed with single concentrations of TLR agonists at single time-points.  There is no indication as to why these concentrations were chosen and whether these are sub-optimal or optimal concentrations.

et al. utilized mice globally deficient in 12/15-LOX and demonstrated an increase in splenic B1 and MZ cell populations and serum and gut lavage (GL) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) IgM. There is also increased BAL IgG and IgA. The finding that enzymes that mediate lipid oxidation may regulate B cell subsets and antibody production is of interest and the paper is well-written.  One of the main findings is that while there is no statistically significant difference in any B cell subset in the peritoneal cavity and Fo B cells in the spleen, there is a modest increase in B1 and MZ B cells in the spleens of 12/15-LOX
-/- mice.  Quantifying the number of cells in a particular B cell subsets is dependent on the gating strategy used to define these subsets.  B cell gating is complex and expression of surface markers used to identify different B cell subsets are context dependent.  Since B1 cells express high levels of CD19 and lower levels of B220 than B2 cells in all tissues

3, gating on CD19
hi B220
low seems more appropriate for B1 cell quantification. In the spleen B1 gating, the authors did not include the CD19
hi B220
low, so likely did not count all the B1 cells.  In addition, CD43 is expressed on B1 cells but not B2 cells. However, in the last plot of the B1 spleen gating strategy (raw data in supplement), the authors appear to have included both CD43
low/- and CD43
+ cell in the B1 cell gate.  An FMO or isotype control could help separate CD43+ from CD43- and ensure that they are not including non B1 cells.  In the peritoneal cavity, in the legend to Figs 3A and 3B, it is mentioned that B1a and B1b cells were determined as CD19

+, CD43
+, CD23

-. However, CD23 is not included in the PerC gating strategy for B1a or B1b cells in the supplemental raw data. In the gating for B1b cells, the authors use CD11b+.  While most of the B1 cells in the PerC are CD11b
+, some B1 cells are CD11b
-
4. Therefore, separating out the CD5- population in terms of CD11b does not further discriminate B1b cells and may even eliminate some.  The gating in PerC using CD43 in the raw data for B1 and B2 identification seems to show that CD43 is not a good discriminator in this location as a good number of the CD43- cells are CD23- (raw data of Fo gating in PerC). Was live/dead staining performed? If yes, it would strengthen the study to include it in all gating schemes.Additional comments and suggestions to consider: Kinder

5 have demonstrated that Alox15 mice exhibit reduced lymphocytes and monocytes in peripheral blood. Percentage of B220+ B cells in the spleen and number of B cell progenitors in the bone marrow were significantly reduced in the Alox15 mice as compared to the wild-type mice. However, in the present study, the authors found an increase in B1 and marginal zone B cells in the spleen of 12/15-LOX
-/-. What is the possible reason for the difference in the results? Did the authors analyze B cell subsets in the blood and bone marrow? Could these mice be different in some other way.  It would help if the authors could provide details on Alox15 deficient mice used in this study and compare them to those used in the Kinder studies. As other cells including eosinophils, adipocytes, epithelial cells also express 12/15-LOX, and the studies were performed using a global knockout, the observed differences may not be due to myeloid-specific expression of 12/15-LOX. It would strengthen the proposed links between the enzyme and biological outcomes if the authors could show levels of 12/15-LOX-mediated lipid metabolites (12-HETE and 15-HETE) and 5-HETE in the serum of wild-type and 12/15-LOX
-/- mice. The conclusion in the abstract that there was “lower serum IgM directed against 12/15-LOX product, 12-HETE-PE” seems overstated as the small reduction in IgM against 12-HETE-PE did not achieve statistical significance even with an n of 40-50. The authors have depicted the percentage change in expression of surface activation markers compared to unstimulated cells. Do the graphs represent change in cell percentage or change in mean fluorescence intensity for different activation markers? The plotted values and flow histogram data do not exactly match. For example, for CD86 expression, the histograms show increase in percentage of positive cells or cell surface expression in stimulated cells as compared to the unstimulated cells for both genotypes. However, the plotted graph shows percent increase in CD86 in LPS treated cells while decrease with loxoribine and CpG treatment considering the unstimulated was 100%. It would be good to see a direct comparison between the wild-type and 12/15-LOX

et al present novel data characterising the B cell compartment in 12/15 lipoxygenase deficient mice. They find that 12/15LOX-/- mice have enhanced serum IgM levels as well as increased IgM, IgA and IgG in the lung. They provide data to show that increased IgM derives from increased levels of spleen B1 and marginal zone (IgM producing) B cell subsets, but that these cells do not display fundamental intrinsic changes in activation thresholds or proliferation. Since B cells do not themselves express 12/15LOX, the phenotype may depend on 12/15LOX functions in macrophages or eosinophils. The data and methods are carefully and accurately described, and the data is interpreted with balance and justification. I have the following minor comments:Methods: A more detailed description, or reference to such, of the broncoalveolar lavage and gut lavage protocols, would help readers to be able to fully reproduce this data.Study design: It is possible that there are minor differences in commensal microbes between mice purchased from Charles River and those bred in house. It is conceivable that this could influence microbe reactive B1 and MZ B cells. Therefore, a more robust comparison would be littermate control mice. The doses of TLR ligands used are high (especially CpG). It is possible that any differences might have been missed. One flow cytometry subset missing that would add further insight to the link between IgM and B1/MZ B cells is plasma cell numbers (CD138+ B220- IgM+ or -) in spleen and bone marrow.Discussion: The authors should consider discussing Baldan
et al 1 that shows a potentially similar phenotype of lung Ig levels in ABCG1-/- mice, since 12/15LOX and ABCG1 may be linked

In this study 140 patients have been included, who were initially recruited for the phase 2, placebo-controlled MS-STAT trial, investigating the effect of simvastatin on brain volume loss after 2 years of treatment. A total of 475 serum samples collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 and 24 months have been analyzed using an unbiased search for protein profiles by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Brain volume changes were measured by MRI Brain Boundary Shift Integral (BBSI) at baseline, 12 months and 25 months. An increased abundance of serum proteins at 15.1 kDa and 15.9 kDa were significantly correlated to the rate of brain atrophy after 2 years. These proteins have then been identified as alpha-hemoglobin and beta hemoglobin using tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, higher serum hemoglobin concentration in SPMS patients compared to controls has been confirmed using ELISA. The authors further studied serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, which has also been shown to be significantly increased in SPMS compared to controls. It was concluded that a low-grade chronic intravascular hemolysis, which is a potential source of iron whose deposition along blood vessels in multiple sclerosis plaques contributes to neurodegeneration and brain atrophy in progressive MS. The results of this study are intriguing and underline other reports on the possible implication of hemoglobin in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, reviewed in Altinoz
et al. (2016). Lewin
et al. hypothesize that increased serum levels of free hemoglobin may trigger iron deposition along blood vessels in MS, which could then propagate neurodegeneration and brain atrophy. While this speculation brings in a new idea, it appears biologically difficult how these processes (e.g. iron deposition along blood vessels in MS lesions and cortical atrophy) should be so tightly linked in time if at all. Otherwise increased iron deposition has been shown to occur in MS using several MRI techniques although due to technical reasons robust quantification of brain iron deposition is currently limited to deep gray matter areas (Ropele
et al. 2011). Longitudinal studies are still scarce, but a recent report indicates that increased brain iron deposition is more pronounced in early phases of the disease (Khalil
et al. 2015). Less information exists on progressive forms of MS but one would speculate that the damaging effects from iron deposition are a long-standing rather than an immediate effect as suggested by Lewin
 et al.. Observed correlation thus are likely not able to clarify if and to which extent increased brain iron deposition really amplifies neurodegeneration in MS or merely reflects an epiphenomenon of the disease. There is also some evidence for alterations of iron related proteins in CSF and serum of MS patients, including transferrin (Khalil
et al. 2014)  and lipocalin 2 (Khalil
 et al. 2016), and which may contribute to iron accumulation. Reiterating some of the concerns and comments of the other reviewers we thus see the need to put reported findings in a more cautious context. Also some methodological issues deserve clarification.Major commentsThe authors should rather use the term “correlated” instead of “associated” and discuss that presented observations do not prove causality as outlined above.For the same reasons the authors should also avoid to embark on therapeutic speculations.The authors state that they analyzed 475 serum samples at different time points (0, 6, 12 and 24 months), however they do not indicate later on how they used the time point a 6 months. Please clarify.It is not clear why the confirmative analysis of free serum hemoglobin using ELISA has only been performed in 20 SPMS patients. It would have been advantageous and the authors a strongly encouraged to determine free serum hemoglobin in all 475 serum to see if increased free serum hemoglobin as determined by ELISA was also correlated with increased brain atrophy.The Discussion should also reflect still existing uncertainties in a more comprehensive manner.  Minor commentsIn Figure 3, p-values (corrected for multiple comparisons) of group differences should be included.In Figure legend 3 it is mentioned that “...Log [haemoglobin] by ELISA was significantly correlated with log(peak intensity): r = 0.52; p = 0.02; linear regression...”.

Half of the MS patients were undergoing treatment with simvastatin,  a drug used to lower blood cholesterol and shown to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Protein profiling of sera was achieved by mass spectrometry of 475 serum samples collected at 0, 12, and 24 months. (A 6‐month time point is mentioned in some places and is queried below). The MS patients had concurrent MRI scans at 0, 12, and 25 months to measure whole brain volume (BBSI – brain boundary shift integral), presumably amongst other measures. Serum samples were “enriched” and analysed by 1D SDS‐PAGE followed by LC‐MS/MS of in gel digested protein. Free haemoglobin (Hb) levels were assessed by ELISA, and activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an indicator of general tissue damage, and particularly of haemolysis was measured. The proteomics analysis suggested that a 15.1‐kDa protein peak correlated with the rate of brain atrophy in seemingly all MS patients, regardless of treatment regime. Following protein enrichment, 15.1‐kDa and 15.9‐kDa peaks were observed and confirmed to represent the α‐ and β-chains of haemoglobin, respectively. In all MS patients, levels of both free Hb chains and of LDH activity were elevated compared to all controls. The results are consistent with the idea that Hb is released into serum by chronic and low‐grade intravascular haemolysis, with subsequent  translocation into the CNS where it has great potential to cause oxidative damage.    Comments on title and abstract –
We suggest that the word “associated” needs to be substituted by “correlated”Conclusions in the abstract must be linked to the objectives of the study rather than be a  speculative claim.    
Comments on study design and data interpretation – Several points require clarification, in our view.    
There were 140 patents, and 60 controls (3 groups of 20). So the total number is supposed to be  200 serum samples per time point. What are the other 275 samples? The question of sample numbers, both of patients and controls, arises again later when 138 patients are mentioned. Additionally, a valuable control could be a group of patients with another neurodegenerative disease characterised by brain atrophy.    The 6‐month time point was not mentioned in the paragraph describing the study design, and there were no results reported for it.For protein profiling by SELDI‐TOF mass spectrometry, after the 1:10 serum dilution, one would  expect signal suppression effect on the lower abundance proteins. To remove this effect it would have been advised to fractionate the serum first, and then use protein chip arrays. Since the authors did not fractionate the sera, it is not possible to rule out other lower‐abundance markers, such as hemopexin, as we indicate next.The Top 12 Protein Depletion Spin Columns are a good way to partially fractionate the serum or to enrich the protein of interest. However, several very important proteins (haptoglobin, transferrin, and Apo AI) related to iron homeostasis will be removed by this procedure. In the context of this study, it is important to see the specific expression patterns of haptoglobin, hemopexin, and HO‐1 since they represent different levels of defence mechanisms against extracellular Hb. Also, it could be beneficial to try and correlate different haptoglobin phenotypes with BBSI.In the same vein, the ELISA kit will detect extracellular Hb from two sources: free Hb and haptoglobin‐bound Hb. The latter form could have been removed by the spin column that was used for protein enrichment.Why and how were only 20 patients selected for ELISA?    
Comments on discussion – We believe that the Discussion can be augmented to give a broader picture as follows.
 
Association versus correlation of brain volume and Hb levels. In our opinion the results show correlation between brain volume and free Hb levels and are insufficient to claim that these two factors are “associated” per se.In reference to [(Bamm and Harauz 2014)], the authors state that “neuropathological evidence does not show frequent or widespread extravascular erythrocytes in the MS brain”. This statement is not strictly correct. Firstly, in [(Bamm and Harauz 2014)] we did not suggest that chronic extravasation of red blood cells is an exclusive source of the abnormal iron deposits. In fact, we said:  “Any type of seemingly minor yet chronic cerebrovascular abnormality and/or damage to the blood– brain barrier, … , can potentially lead to
 intravascular hemolysis, or to extravasation of erythrocytes and extravascular hemolysis”. Secondly, as we reviewed recently [(Bamm et al. 2016)], extracellular Hb could arise from blood extravasation due to capillary and venous micro‐hemorrhages, which ARE being documented in MS lesions, as possibly are cerebral microbleeds (CBMs) [(Zivadinov
et al. 2016)]. Such events can be difficult to detect at the histological level, especially in the early stages of lesion formation that can arise from molecular dysfunction rather than gross structural damage. The  potential molecular mechanisms of Hb toxicity in myelin are described in a subsequent experimental  paper [(Bamm
et al. 2015)] and do not rely on large‐scale iron deposition. The damage inflicted by free Hb can arise at many different levels and per se will not necessarily be associated with the number of extravasated erythrocytes in MS tissue.In reference to erythrocyte fragility in MS, we suggest also citing one of the earlier papers to indicate that this is an old idea that has been insufficiently explored [(Caspary
et al.1967)], and two newer papers that describe the association of haemoglobin variants with MS severity [(Altinoz
et al. 2016; Ozcan
et al. 2016)].It is not clear how the finding of higher free Hb in the sera of MS patients can be explained. The  authors reported that the mean erythrocytes count and total blood Hb did not differ between MS patients and control groups. However, the MS patients were characterized by the increased presence of free Hb. If a simple formula for total Hb is: Hb within the erythrocytes + cell‐free Hb, and the erythrocyte count was similar, then the amounts of cell‐free Hb should be similar. Is the morphology of erythrocytes from MS patients and controls different? Perhaps the erythrocytes from MS patients were hypochromic (less intracellular Hb)? We believe that the authors should clarify this  point.  The first line of defense against extracellular haemoglobin is haptoglobin (Hpt). We have determined recently that the frequency of the hpt1 allele is lower in Australia, and in European and North American countries with a high reported prevalence of MS [(Bamm
et al. 2016)]. We also recommended an epidemiological study to evaluate the potential association of Hpt phenotype with disease severity and/or comorbidity with cardiovascular disorders, as is being done for Parkinsonism  [(Costa‐Mallen
et al. 2015; Delanghe
et al. 2016; Costa‐Mallen
et al. 2016)]. It should also be pointed out that cardiovascular disorders have been found to be associated with disease severity and brain  atrophy in MS [(Kappus
et al. 2016)]. This latter reference is certainly relevant to the Discussion of this current study.

This was originally observed by the authors using an unbiased proteomics approach, aimed at determining potential serum biomarkers for disease progression. The patient collective derives from a well-controlled clinical trial investigating the effect of simvastatin on the rate of brain atrophy progression in secondary progressive MS. Having found this association, the authors then confirmed free hemoglobin increase in SPMS patients by an independent approach using ELISA. The study is very well performed, based on a sound and innovative technology and the results have major implications for the understanding of the neurodegenerative process in MS. Interestingly, the association between haemoglobin serum level increase and atrophy rate occurred independently from the effect of simvastatin treatment. Thus increased haemoglobin in the serum may contribute to the neurodegenerative process, but there are other mechanisms additionally involved. By showing also increased levels of serum LDH the authors further support the concept that there is a low degree of hemolysis in the peripheral blood of MS patients, which however is not reflected in reduction of erythrocyte counts, haematocrit or total blood haemoglobin. However, it would also be interesting to address whether there is an association between actual free hemoglobin levels at any of the single time points (not their change over time), as determined by mass spectrometry, and the observed brain atrophy rates. Authors only show a positive association of free hemoglobin increase with brain atrophy levels, which might have a different interpretation than what the authors conclude. Furthermore, the quantitative ELISA data are not linked with MRI brain atrophy rates. Were the 20 MS patients included in the ELISA quantification taken from the big cohort of the proteomics part of the study? Then MRI data would be available, and the analysis could be easily performed. There is good indirect evidence that iron loading of the brain may be involved in neurodegeneration in MS through the amplification of oxidative injury. So far, the mechanisms how the human brain is loaded with iron during aging and in the disease process of MS is not fully understood. This study indicates that heme iron, derived from free circulating haemoglobin, may be of major importance in brain iron accumulation in the course of multiple sclerosis. Free hemoglobin, presumably bound to the haemoglobin scavenger haptoglobin, might diffuse into the brain via a partially compromised blood-brain barrier and might lead to iron accumulation within MS basal ganglia and microglia at edges of chronic lesions. The key question, which however remains unresolved here, concerns the cause of increased free haemoglobin in the blood of MS patients. Interestingly, it has already been shown in the late 1960ths that erythrocyte diameters are larger in MS patients (J. Prineas,1968) and that there is a higher fragility of erythrocytes in comparison to controls, which may result in liberation of haemoglobin (E.A. Caspary
et al.,1967). These observations together with more recent findings, which relate them to other disturbances of iron homeostasis in MS, have been recently discussed in a comprehensive review article (Altinoz
et al., 2016). Whether the increased erythrocyte fragility is a genuine metabolic problem or a consequence of a general systemic chronic pro-inflammatory environment in the MS patients is currently unresolved.We have read this submission.

Further, such approaches result in the acquisition of large volumes of data whose analyses are complex and time consuming.  The quality and quantity of sleep is widely recognized as important for general health across a wide range of organisms and method described in this manuscript provides an interesting and readily adaptable system to enable many labs to quantify sleep in mice. This approach quantifies immobility (40s epochs) and uses this as an index of sleep state.  They validate COMPASS through careful and sophisticated comparison to sleep as measured through the conventional electroencephalogram (EEG) method.  In general this is a very well-written and nicely illustrated manuscript, with the details and validation of COMPASS readily understandable.    
In the analysis of this PIR-based method, mice with fully functional circadian and sleep regulation were used (the C57BL6 animal).  Can the authors speculate on the effectiveness of this approach in animals such as orexin knockout mice in which overall sleep in 24h does not differ to that of controls, but where there is an increase in cataplexy? Specifically, how will this method distinguish between immobility due to a motor disorder versus a bonafide sleep alteration?

NA,NA,Brown,Laurence,NA,"University of Oxford, UK",NA,"Dear Professor Piggins, Thank you for the helpful review of our work.  We have added to the discussion in order to stress the importance of careful interpretation of results for sleep based on immobility alone.  It is interesting that sudden-onset bouts of sleep (cataplexy) might be missed or underestimated using ≥40s of immobility as criteria, but that in groups with the same overall amounts of sleep, this would lead to a decrease in the reported sleep each day and therefore a difference when compared to wild-type litter-mates.  Our recent use of the COMPASS system alongside voluntary running wheel activity would suggest that the PIRs often give a more sensitive and unbiased measure of overall activity. Mice are often awake active, but not running in a wheel. However, we acknowledge that more data is needed before activity (and consequently, immobility) alone could be used to reliably separate motor deficits from changes in the parameters of circadian rhythmicity or sleep, especially as many of the mutant mice studied have complex phenotypes",11,4,2017,2017-4-11,PMC5140024,Method Article,27976750,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.9892.2,COMPASS: Continuous Open Mouse Phenotyping of Activity and Sleep Status.,2016-11-15,methods-article; journal article;

Careful calibration of this system will allow users to simultaneously assess sleep status in mice. The use of open-source tools and simple sensors keeps the cost and the size of data-files down.  We looked over the plans and felt that we could implement this system.  Broadly, this is a very promising approach to address an important issue i.e. measurement of sleep in rodents using a high-throughput system.  While we are generally supportive, we did have some problems with the present ms.  First, as the authors well know, inactivity is not the same as sleep.  Some more validation of their sleep measurements is important.  For example, do hypnotics increase and stimulants alter PIR defined sleep?  When the mice are sleeping can they demonstrate the increase in threshold to external stimuli?  The authors undertook this type of validation in their prior study with video analysis and we feel that they should do the same type of validation with this new methodology.  In addition, we would like them to compare sleep fragmentation with the IR and compare that to values obtained with the EEG.  Sleep fragmentation is an important parameter in disease models and should be detected with their methodology.  Their prior video-based system was effective in measuring this parameter.  It was unclear if the mice needed to have an empty cage in between the measurement cages.  We do not see why this would be the case but the illustration in Fig. 1 suggests the need for a separating cage.  Please clarify.  We were uncertain as to the utility of the cluster analysis.  We did like the clear demonstration that the intra-day patterns were stable between mice.  But we felt that the cluster analysis would be more useful if it compared the inverse of activity in top panel with the IR-defined sleep below.  This would help address the issue of whether IR-defined sleep is more than the absence of activity.  Finally, several labs have been exploring the use of behavior measures of sleep including IR measures as used in the present study.  The authors should expand this part of their discuss to include others working in this space.We have read this submission.

NA,NA,Brown,Laurence,NA,"University of Oxford, UK",NA,"Dear Dr Loh and Professor Colwell Thank you for your review and the important points that you raise. On the first point we agree that we should continually reassess of the use of immobility as a surrogate of EEG-defined sleep. However, we would consider the use of passive infrared sensors as a more efficient way of assessing immobility, rather than a new methodology to measure sleep.  As you have discussed, the previous work from the group with video tracking showed that hypnotics increase and stimulants decrease immobility.  It is definitely the case that data from the COMPASS system will allow efficient measurement of bouts of both activity and sleep, as well as measures of stability in these bouts.  This is one area where long-term recordings will be especially useful.  We are focusing current and future efforts on this aspect of analysis, but we wish to collect data from a number of known sleep and circadian mutant models first. One additional advantage of the .csv file format used is that it provides easier import of data in to existing programs for bout-analysis and measures of fragmentation with which groups might already be familiar.  In order to help demonstrate how analysis of bouts could be approached we have included another notebook for download with the revised paper (COMPASS_sleep_bouts.ipynb). It is also possible to look at the PIR and EEG-defined sleep in
Figure 2 at a higher temporal resolution. Averaging sleep with each system over 5min bins further supports the suggestion that small waking movements in the light period would be the main source of error for the PIR-based estimate of sleep.  Consequently, this would lead to longer uninterrupted bouts of sleep being recorded with PIRs. A note to this effect has been added to the revised manuscript (along with a supplementary version of
Figure 2). You are correct that, provided the sensors have been correctly tested, there is no need to leave empty cages between those in use.  As one sensor is shown reading from a neighbouring cage, we left some empty in
Figure 1.  A note to this effect has been added to the legend of
Figure 1. We have added a comparison of the hierarchical clustering of the 24 wild-type mice from immobility (>0s) verses sleep defined as extended immobility (>40s)  (now included in the revised paper as a supplement to
Figure 5). This shows that sleep will be over-estimated based on immobility alone, and that the clustering of mice by their immobility (>0s) vs extended immobility (>40s) profiles differs, illustrating that sleep behaviour is not simply the inverse of locomotor activity.  Finally, we agree that by keeping the focus on the practicalities of this particular system, we neglected to describe the extent of other efforts towards a non-invasive estimate of sleep.  We have expanded the discussion in an attempt to cover others working in this field, with regard to both improvements in methodology and uses of non-invasive measures of sleep in biomedical research.",11,4,2017,2017-4-11,PMC5140024,Method Article,27976750,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.9892.2,COMPASS: Continuous Open Mouse Phenotyping of Activity and Sleep Status.,2016-11-15,methods-article; journal article;

In answer to the points you raise we can confirm that the original positioning of the PIR sensor at 440mm was at the top of our environmental chambers, in which the cages sat.  As is indicated by the video we published, the detection of small movements by the mice was poor at this height.  Our findings in preliminary experiments looked at sleep assessed by the video-tracking protocol previously used in our lab and the PIRs. We found the correlation of video-tracking and PIRs at 440mm from the cage floor often fell below 0.75 (Pearson’s r, over 24h), but with the sensors at 200-220mm from the cage floor, the correlation between methods was very high (Pearson’s r, >0.98).  These experiment were carried out on different mice to the EEG experiments.  As both of these methods are based on immobility we felt it was best to focus on the comparison with EEG-scored sleep.",11,4,2017,2017-4-11,PMC5140024,Method Article,27976750,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.9892.2,COMPASS: Continuous Open Mouse Phenotyping of Activity and Sleep Status.,2016-11-15,methods-article; journal article;

The system is based on passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors. Using 40 seconds of immobility as an indicator of sleep, the authors demonstrate that PIR based estimates of sleep correlated very well with EEG recordings from implanted telemetry transmitters. In general, the work is very well described, allowing other researchers to use this system in their animal facilities, but there are a few points that it would be useful to clarify:
Second paragraph of the introduction. The fourth sentence should be rewritten to make it clear that the import, re-derivation and breeding issues relate to access to specialised facilities.In the methods it would be helpful if the authors could identify the cage type they used. By small gaps do they mean the spaces under the feed and water hoppers?The authors note that no environmental enrichment can be used that might fully obscure the animal. Can the authors confirm that some nesting material was available but presumably was limited in quantity?The authors used cages in light tight boxes. Have they tested their PIR system in more conventional animal caging?

NA,NA,Brown,Laurence,NA,"University of Oxford, UK",NA,"Dear Professor Wells Thank you for your review. We hope the revised manuscript will address the important points you raised:
We agree this should be clarified.  We have rewritten this paragraph in the revised manuscript.This is correct. In some cages we have food and water hoppers mounted externally, so no further modification was needed, but where the water bottles and food are integrated into the wire of the cage lid, a Perspex block was used to ensure the mice were active and nested in view of the sensor.  We have added the cages types used in the paper to the revised version.We provided nesting materials for all of the mice in the study and in preliminary work. This was paper-based Sizzle-Nest, or cotton fibre Nestlets, with a minimum of 10g in each cage (in excess of that required for thermoregulation by mice with similar materials, Gaskill et al 2012, PLOS ONE, (
http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0032799).
We are currently collecting data with collaborators in a range of cage sizes and types of racking. For some types of cage, particularly those with food and water hoppers recessed in the centre of the cage lid rather than at one end, it will be difficult to ensure complete coverage of the cage. Individually-ventilated cages (IVCs) would need modification for the integration of PIR sensors, as the polycarbonate material most are constructed with will block the 5-10µm infrared wavelengths of body heat.

ROTEM parameters.to diagnose hyperfibrinolysis:
Please clarify the type of ROTEM analyzer: delta or sigma.Concerning APTEM test, please make sure with TEM-international that the antifibrinolytic reagant used has been changed from aprotinin to tranexamic acid and precise the concentration of the APTEM reagant.Please clarify if the quality control Rotrol will be performed by the trained personnel every week as commonly or before each of test.Replace ""is administered"" by ""administration""Lysis onset time LOT has been used to increase the performance of ROTEM analysis to detect and diagnose hyperfibrinolysis (Faraoni
et al. 2015) should be also an interesting parameter to be tested
 p5:
Definition of the coagulopathy:
The definition of the coagulopathy seems to be based on the trauma definition of the coagulopathy and hyperfibrinolysis: INR >1.2 and A5 < 40mm and ML>15% on ROTEM respectively.The PPH associated coagulopathy and ROTEM cutoff have been described by Huissoud (2009) then Collins (2014).Because the thrombin generation and plasmin generation seems very close and appears both early in the course of PPH (Ducloy-bouthors
et al. P-011&-012, 2017), and the decrease in fibrinogen seems parallel to the increase in D-dimers, the cutoffs established by Collins to diagnose PPH induced coagulopathy should be used. Because ISTH DIC score is not sensible in PPH population and the new score has been validated (Jonard
et al. 2016), the threshold to should be adapted
 P6:
 
Secondary parameters:
Timed measure of fibrinolytic activity after childbirth needs a better description in non haemorrhagic as well as untreated and treated haemorhagic groups. The WOMAN-ETAC data will be very helpful to this better understanding and ongoing TRACES trial () will complete these data. The duration of both the hyperfibrinolytic activity and the tranexamic action is also very useful to establish with no previous data.The duration and intensity of the antifibrinolytic activity should be interconnected with the estimated bleeding volume and the initial estimated bleeding flow. To be aware of the estimated initial bleeding volume and flow, two methods may be used and mutually consolidated: the visual estimation (although imperfect) and the hemoglobin delta between end of pregnancy and the first available hemoglobin (if possible before dilution due to vascular loading). The resuscitation and transfusion parameters should be considered to understand the variation of the coagulopathic and fibrinolytic process.Type of delivery: Delivery is not spontaneously traumatic and obstetrics coagulation activation should not be considered as a trauma induced coagulation and fibrinolysis activation. The aim of this coagulation and fibrinolysis activation is the physiological closure of the placental vascular bed after placental removal. This coagulation and fibrinolytic activation remains local and uterine-limited since the uterine tone blocks the dissemination of the large amounts of tissue factor. In trauma patients, initial shock and tissue damage are directly correlated to coagulopathy and mortality, whereas initial obstetrics coagulation and fibrinolysis activity is rarely associated with shock, even in late and severe evolution when transfusion and vascular loading are given. Thus as the authors expect, the type of delivery will not influence when considering the placental bed coagulation and fibrinolytic activation. However in the instrumental delivery as well as in caesarean section, the surgical part of the bleeding may be so severe that the hypovolemic shock could be associated. Perhaps should it be possible to analyze in clinical parameters the origin of bleeding and to confirm these data by a lactate measurement on the initial and 30 minutes blood samples.Maternal anemia is an interesting topic where tranexamic acid may reach an important public health objective. Goswani
et al. (2013) already showed this favourable impact in prophylactic use during non haemorrhagic CS.

Given that the study has now finished, and the data analysis plan finalised and the study un-blinded (as per the abstract discussion) it would be inappropriate to suggest any changes to the protocol or analysis. There are however a number of ways in which the protocol could be written more clearly so as to ensure clarity for those wishing to replicate or understand the study:
In METHODS (b) it would be good to state exactly how long after the blood sample was taken it was analysed and whether any steps were taken to ensure that the sample did not deteriorate (eg kept on ice, or analysed within a certain time period)In the same section it would be good to be explicit about how long the ROTEM protocol lasted and stating that (I assume) the ROTEM was allowed to run for the full X minutes. This is important for the assessment of lysis as that may continue to change for some time and so lysis data would be different if the ROTEM was interrupted at 10 minutes or at 20 minutes.Can the authors clarify who took the samples and put them through the ROTEM analysis, and whether the results were then revealed to the clinicians? If it was, it could have the effect of unblinding those doing the clinical care and collecting the data.In ANALYSIS, the definition of ML and A5 need to be clarified.I assume that there are 2 of each of the ROTEM measurements for each participant with one relating to the EXTEM and the other for the APTEM. If not, then please clarify this in the script – but if there is, then each description of MCF, A5 etc should clarify which measure it comes from.At the bottom of ‘Main analysis’ it states that the machine may not give data if there was 'no clot detected'. Is this correct? Surely the sodium citrate will prevent clot formation and it is only if ‘Clot Detected’ that the analyser will not work.

I have focussed on the analysis section as this is where my expertise lies. Some consideration should be given to the possibility of under-representation of women with more severe PPH, and how that may affect the conclusions of the study. Since some time is required to take the blood samples before the first dose of study drug is administered, is there a possibility that the more severe cases of PPH will not be included in this sub-study, or may have a baseline value but no follow-up value? An analysis examining the representativeness of the women included in the sub-study versus the remainder in the main WOMAN study may help to assess this issue. The use of a per-protocol analysis population is reasonable, given the objective of the study. With regard to the definition of this population, should this also exclude women who have received a second dose of study drug before the follow-up blood samples were taken, in the rare cases when this might happen? Have the authors considered conducting a sensitivity analysis using an intention to treat analysis population to assess the robustness of the conclusions? The authors specify that they will use t-tests as well as regression analyses adjusting for baseline values to analyse the outcomes. They should make clear which analysis method will be considered the primary analysis. It would also be helpful to include how the outcome data will be reported (for example as adjusted mean differences), and if confidence intervals and/or p-values will be reported. The level of confidence intervals for the primary and secondary outcome results should also be specified, as well as the level to be used for statistical significance. The rationales for each of the sub-group analyses are clearly described. A brief description of the method of analysis should also be included. Will tests of interaction be reported?

WOMAN is a pragmatic, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and is intended to determine reliably the effect of the early administration of TXA on death, hysterectomy, and other morbidity (surgical intervention, blood transfusion and risk of nonfatal vascular events). Recruitment of the 20,000 planned randomized women has been completed as well as statistical analysis. The aim of this sub-study is to assess the effect of TXA on thrombin generation but also on platelet function, fibrinogen, D-dimer and coagulation factors in women with PPH. The authors hypothesize that TXA will decrease thrombin generation by inhibiting plasmin and modify platelet activity, coagulation factors V and VIII and Von Willebrand levels in women with PPH. The protocol of the WOMAN trial has been previously published elsewhere. In this sub-study, it is planned, only on a single site located in Albania, to obtain blood samples immediately after randomization and before the administration of the first dose of trial treatment as well as about 30±15 minutes after the administration of the first dose of trial drugs (but before the second dose of trial treatment if required). Platelet function will be assessed immediately on site using Multiplate®tests, while other samples will be centrifugated and preserved at -80°C to be transferred in Germany for later analysis of Thrombin generation Assay, fibrinogen, D-dimers, coagulation factors V and VIII and Von Willebrand levels. The protocol is well written, original and will provide useful, interesting and likely robust data related to the impact of TXA on hemostasis of PPH women. I have only minor comments.
The authors should explain why only one site participates to the WOMAN trial sub-study.The primary outcome should be clinically (and in pathophysiological manner) justified: Endogenous Thrombin Potential difference of 243nM/min.  The sample size should be based on literature or the authors should mention that, as this analysis is exploratory, it is somewhat arbitrary.The authors should clearly note that analysis will be performed blindly.The authors should clearly mention what material laboratory will be used to assess Thrombin generation Assay, fibrinogen, D-dimers, coagulation factors V and VIII and Von Willebrand levels.

The author could have estimated passive aggression by dividing the number of mosquitoes collected per room by the number of sleepers in the room and then estimate the EIR. These parameters were initially considered at the beginning of this study (the number of people who slept in the room). At some point, we noticed some inconsistencies in the number of sleepers provided by households. It was a bit difficult to verify this discrepancy because our mosquito sampling was done in the morning when most sleepers have left the rooms (morning collections).

The authors may want to consider the following points:Comments from Manisha NairI understand that the primary aim of this study was to generate evidence about the effect of TXA on thrombin generation, platelet function and coagulation factors in women with PPH. However, this study could also provide answers to why TXA had or did not have the desired effect. In this context it would be important to analyse how the TXA effect is modified by baseline haemoglobin, platelets and coagulation factors, especially considering a high prevalence of anaemia during pregnancy in LMICs. I am surprised that the authors did not pre-specify this, but intend to conduct this only as an exploratory analysis. Clearly, these sub-group analyses will be underpowered to derive any meaningful results. In the second paragraph under sub-heading “Exploratory subgroup analyses” (page-6), authors write, “A further sensitivity analysis will be done by adjusting for severity of PPH (Table 5) and fibrinogen level or platelet count” – I presume this is fibrinogen or platelet count
at baseline?In Table 2, authors have grouped induction and augmentation of labour. These are two different interventions and would probably be better to report them separately.Will there be any information about the management of third stage of labour for those who underwent vaginal delivery?The participants will be recruited at a point when they are diagnosed with PPH, so some women particularly in LMICs are likely to be rushed into the hospital and may not have records of antenatal care. Will it be possible to have complete information on preclampsia, chorioamnionitis, diabetes, placental abruption, placenta praevia, previous PPH and other baseline parameters? Therefore, will it not be difficult to ascertain the cause of PPH at least for some women? The authors do not comment on these issues and resultant missing data and how this will be handled in the analyses.My concern is that the authors propose a lot of tests with a small sample. Although these are important, I am not sure if the results will be meaningful. While we will know if TXA had an effect on three coagulation parameters, but we will not know in which population groups this drug works well and in which it may not.Comments from Louise LinsellPage 3 Study design, 1st paragraph Add that this sub-study is in a single centre.

Suggest, ""Women with PPH for whom the physician believes there is an indication or contraindication to use TXA will be excluded.""Page 4 Full analysis dataset, 1st paragraph Please clarify that women who have withdrawn consent to use their data will be excluded from the ITT analysis. Will women with a follow-up measure but no baseline measure be included in the ITT analysis?Page 4 Per protocol set, 1st paragraph The bullet points after ""No major protocol violations were detected"" are not clear and do not make sense.

It is stated that these are exploratory, however if they are pre-specified and statistical tests are conducted, then the results should be reported in full as part of the main trial report. There are also blocks of text reporting evidence from other studies that detract attention and disrupt the flow of the SAP. Perhaps it would be clearer to have one SAP for the analysis and reporting of the main trial results and any pre-specified subgroup analysis in which all results are reported in full and a second SAP outlining any further exploratory analysis investigating the pathology/epidemiology.CONSORT Flowchart Please include a CONSORT flowchartAdherence  It would be useful to report measures of compliance and other useful information by trial arm, e.g. number of damaged, misallocated packs, time from randomisation to drug administration, time from baseline to 2nd measurement, number of 2nd doses administered.We have read this submission.

Manisha Nair:
We approach the search for factors at baseline which modify the effect of TXA on thrombin generation (etc.) by the formal analysis of an interaction between the treatment and the corresponding baseline parameter on the specific outcome. As mentioned in your comment, we did not power the study to detect specific interactions.Furthermore, we did not prespecify subgroup analyses to assess possible effect modifications of baseline parameters on the treatment.In the section “Covariates and Subgroups” we addressed this issue. According to your comments we tried to make this point more obvious.We see now the task to reduce the reporting of post hoc subgroup analyses.Since we have grouped the patient with induced and augmentation of labour in data collection form, it is difficult to separate, so we will remove these data from the SAP. There are no data concerning management of third stage of labour.There are no missing values regarding concomitant and preexisting diseases of pregnancy.The total sample size is small and the subgroup analyses run the risk of false positive. We will react by removing the exploratory subgroup analysis.

Nevertheless, I consider that there is one aspect that is puzzling and might be improved. As part of the sample size determination, the authors calculate the variance of the change from baseline measure of ETP This might be fair enough for the purpose of sample size determination. However, it is well known that this is an inefficient use of baselines and that one can do better by including the baseline as a covariate
1. The section headed
Efficacy analyses of primary outcome states:In analysis of the primary outcome(TGA– ETP), the TXA group will be compared with the placebo group, based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) which adjusts for the length of time between two measurements (30±15 minutes) of the baseline and follow-up TGA - ETP value  This does not, therefore, appear to adjust for the baseline value (apart for the crude and inefficient adjustment through subtraction). On the other hand, there is an adjustment for the length of time between the two measurements. This implies that this length of time is itself considered to be predictive. That is to say it is supposed that two women given identical treatment would be expected to have different values of TGA according to the length of time it takes to measure TGA. This may well be reasonable (if some secular trend in TGA is expected) but in that case I would have expected some discussion of the point. In short, I consider that the plan shows evidence of careful thought on the part of the authors but still leaves room for some doubt as regards the analysis. I must thus conclude that either the analysis proposed is not optimal or that the authors have failed to provide sufficient clarity to entirely convince at least one reader of its appropriateness.I have read this submission.

Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.11092.r18611,Sharp,Thomas H.,NA,"1Section Electron Microscopy, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Leiden, Netherlands",approve,"Brama et al. describe the development of two fluorescent microscopes to aid the experimenter in finding back cells or regions of interest in IRF blocks, while sectioning the block. One of these microscopes, the ultraLM, can be incorporated into an ultramicrotome, whilst the other, dubbed miniLM, can be built into a block-face SEM. By monitoring the fluorescent signal from an IRF block while sectioning, the researcher can target specific regions of interest which are labelled with a fluorophore, thereby making the sectioning and imaging much more efficient, and enabling future automation. Because the limited space available in these devices, integrating the fluorescent microscopes meant compromises had to be made, for instance, on the final resolution of the microscopes. In the manuscript, the authors very clearly explain the requirements and the construction of these devices, and show the workings of the microscopes by using GFP-H2B expressing cells as proof-of-principle samples. Furthermore, the authors anticipate that the miniLM can be used in the future to allow smart-tracking of specific regions within cells or tissue in the block-face SEM. Despite the limited resolution, we anticipate that both the ultraLM and the miniLM will be useful for processing IRF sample blocks containing sparse samples, or rare events, labelled with endogenously expressed fluorophores, and will fasten the imaging process significantly. However, we do have some recommendations to the authors, which are listed as follows:
In the design requirements for each microscope, the authors specify a minimum resolution that should be obtained, in both cases 1 µm. For both microscopes however, this requirement is not met. For the ultraLM, the theoretical resolution of the system, however, was calculated to be ~600 nm. The authors do not further address this discrepancy in the desired, the theoretical and the actual resolution, although in the discussion several improvements are suggested to improve the resolution.For the resolution measurement of the miniLM, in Figure 4E, a smoothing filter was used, according the Methods section. We recommend also mentioning this in the legend of Figure 4, for clarity, and describing the exact filter used (mean, Gaussian, etc).In the text, and the Methods section, it is mentioned that an
achromatic lens is used for the ultraLM. However, Thorlabs component A240-A, as mentioned in the Methods section, is an
aspheric lens. Either the wrong part number is being used, or the text should be adapted. Since only single colour microscopy is being done here, we do not see any problems with using an aspherical lens.It would be valuable to include a mention of the sensitivity of the microscopes. For instance, how much fluorescence should be present in the sample to be detected? We believe this is useful information for other prospective users of the systems.Aligning the fluorescence and EM images of Figure 7C would allow the reader to directly see the correlation between the two modalities, which is not clear to us.To our understanding, Figure 2D is a top view of the miniLM. For clarity, we advise the authors to mention this in the figure legend.As a general remark, the figures presenting microscope images could be made clearer to the reader. For instance, Figure 3D could depict the fluorescence and electron images separately as well as an overlay.

The ultraLM can be attached to an ultramicrotome to record FM images of the resin block while cutting sections. The miniLM was designed to be integrated into an SEM for serial block face imaging. Both systems will be of great use for the CLEM community. As pointed out by the authors, often only a sparse population of the cells show the fluorescent label. Being able to identify these cells while cutting sections or to allow following particular cells in block face imaging will make the often tedious CLEM workflow substantially more efficient. The article provides a detailed description of the necessary hardware and optical components and a link to the python software for controlling the microscopes. The authors have characterized the resolution of both FM imaging systems and have demonstrated that fluorescent cells can be identified and correlated with the EM images. Therefore, both miniLM and ultraLM serve as excellent “fluorescence-guided cell locator tools”. Currently, it seems that the relatively limited resolution of both systems is the biggest obstacle for identifying subcellular features in FM. For both systems Brama et al. have self-imposed a resolution requirement of “at least 1 μm for subcellular feature recognition”. This resolution has not been reached and subcellular features have not been shown in the example images. In the case of the miniLM, the optical fibre seems to be the most limiting component. Future designs that provide a window might not require this. A temporary solution might be to increase the magnification of the miniature objective to decrease the effect of the individual cores in the fibre on the resolution, but at the expense of the available FOV. For the ultraLM, a Zemax (or similar software) model might help to identify what causes the decreased optical performance of the imaging lens compared to the theoretical value and how to improve the optical design. In Fig. 1 numbering the sections or encircling them with different colours might help to illustrate which are the same in FM and EM and which are different ones (i.e. not CLEM images of the same section). FM images of a cut section will only show signals from this section. The images from the ultraLM are taken from the whole remaining block and considering the large depth of focus, the fluorescent signals in utlraLM images are originating from a volume of >30 μm thickness. This might be important to mention also in the discussion, as the ultraLM allows to find quicker the fluorescently labelled cells as compared to FM imaging in a separate microscope, but (for samples that consist of more than a 2D layer of cells) it is less specific as the fluorescent cell can only be located with a relative low precision in the axial direction.I have read this submission.

This is largely a technical apparatus description and is well stated and easy to understand. This microscope is designed in a small form factor so as not to interfere with the normal operation of cutting. In the first case it adds fluorescent optical imaging from the exposed sample surface that is mounted on a commercial ultra microtome. An even more compact microscope is mounted on a serial block face system (3 view Gatan which generates 3D SEM images) cutting assembly and fits in the few mm between the SEM and the sample. These are clever implementations of correlative microscopy worth noting. By virtue of the forced lower numerical aperture the magnification is lower and constrained to cell identification applications. This does have the feel of a first pass at the microscope and the authors do suggest improvements for known issues (e.g. the accelerometer for position accuracy). Still some deeper carefully considered elaboration for a second generation system would be helpful. I would have one further recommendation: To really make explicit the “correlation” between light and electron images. It would be very valuable to see corresponding specific features in both of the images, but I can’t pick this out from the figures or movies. Corresponding and properly oriented and aligned cropped regions should be shown side by side and by overlay to really make this important point to the reader. This should be in the existing data and would directly illustrate the main claim of the paper for potential for cell identification in SEM and light images.I have read this submission.

The ultraLM can be integrated with an ultramicrotome to detect fluorescence within the block during sectioning. Proof-of-principle ultraLM operation was demonstrated using IRF blocks containing cultured cells expressing GFP-H2B in nucleus. Although this specimen served the purpose of showing that the fluorescence imaging can be conducted during sectioning, it does not bring out the full potential of the system, as GFP-positive cells were spread evenly within the cell pellet. The ultraLM will benefit greatly applications with sparsely-labelled cell populations and genetically-modified model organisms where only subset of tissue is positive, as explained in the discussion. The miniLM operates inside the scanning electron microscope (SEM) chamber in conjunction with serial block face imaging (SBF-SEM). Despite the tight space constrains of the SBF-SEM the authors were able to fit a fluorescent microscope into the system. The system demonstrates decent quality of the florescent signal and has potential for navigation of SBF-SEM imaging to the areas of interest once the software for the smart-tracking is ready. The article provides electronic scheme and the control software enabling replication of the instruments elsewhere. It seems that the weakness of the system is related to the hardware part of the miniLM leading to rather large inter-step deviation (as shown on Figure 7 and Movie S3) that may hamper proper correlation between EM and LM images and development of more automated system in the future. The current design is using an accelerometer to identify the moment when LM image should be taken. Would it be possible that the low precision of the accelerometer is  bigger contributing factor to the inter-step deviation than the mechanical instability or jitter caused by electric noise? Have the authors considered any other alternative to detect the stopping point? For example, high precision linear or rotary optical encoders have resolution up to several nanometers. We have two recommendations for changing the manuscript.
The authors provide the control software written in the Python programming language for collecting and saving images. However, the provided functions cannot be used alone and have multiple dependencies. It would be nice if all required dependencies were additionally listed in the manuscript.Figure 8 illustrates the workflow for automation of integrated 3D LM and EM using the miniLM. Images are somewhat misleading, as the size of the fluorescent spot in LM and organelle profiles in EM images are about 10 times smaller than the operation scale of the miniLM. Resolution of the miniLM system has to be improved significantly before it enables single organelle tracking. Images exemplifying cell tracking might be more appropriate.

Far from being a technical shortcoming with little practical consequence, the authors demonstrate that the failure to account for stimulus variance can markedly (and spuriously) inflate inferential statistics, with the worst inflation occurring with large numbers of participants and small numbers of unique stimuli. The authors present an analytic solution to this problem, as well as recommending a number of design precepts that can ameliorate the problem even while still using the standard fixed-effect analysis approach. This is an important issue, which is particularly timely given growing concerns in the field about reproducibility, and the case the authors make is compelling. However, the manuscript left us with a number of outstanding questions. We think it would be helpful to the readers to point out that most fMRI studies are not looking to make generalizations about classes of stimuli. For example, a memory researcher will typically use a fixed set of stimuli (e.g., faces or words) for study. But the stimuli are typically counter-balanced or randomly assigned across experimental conditions (e.g., studied items or non-studied items) and across subjects, in which case, modeling random effects for the stimuli is not necessary. It’s only in limited cases in which generalizations about stimuli are being claimed (e.g., greater activity for nouns compared to verbs) that it becomes necessary. The authors do mention in the introduction that a “review of 100 random task-based fMRI article extracted from the Neurosynth database . . . used multiple stimuli in a context where generalizations over stimuli was clearly indicated.” [the authors indicated that details about this procedure could be found in the supplementary materials, but we could not find them] However, this strikes us as not representative of published fMRI studies. In any case, we think the authors should make it clear that the concerns they raise only apply to those studies that make generalizations about classes of stimuli. The biggest issue that was not addressed in the current manuscript is how the stimulus-as-fixed-effect issue impacts analytic approaches other than the standard mass univariate GLM. (Indeed, the authors occasionally seem to ignore the existence of other approaches, as when they claim there is a “universal failure of fMRI studies” to acknowledge stimulus variability.) For example, it would seem that many applications of representational similarity analysis (RSA; Kriegeskorte, Mur, & Bandettini, 2008
1) are not affected by this issue. Relatedly, it is not uncommon for researchers to include various parametric regressors that may vary across stimuli within the same class; does such an approach do anything to address the stimulus-as-fixed-effect issue, and conversely, is the authors’ proposed RSM approach compatible with the use of parametric regressors? Similarly, a recent report by Abdulrahman and Henson
2 addressed the question of variability, not just at the stimulus level, but at the trial level. Indeed, although that paper was primarily concerned with multivariate approaches, they somewhat surprisingly found that trial-level methods (namely, the “least-squares separate” and “least-squares all” methods of Mumford, Turner, Ashby, & Poldrack, 2012
3) could sometimes outperform traditional approaches even in the context of the GLM. Westfall and colleagues should explain whether (and if so, how) the stimulus-as-fixed-effect issue impacts alternative analysis approaches like RSA and the use of parametric regressors, and whether they would expect trial-level methods to play any role in ameliorating (or exacerbating) the issue. There were also some details which were glossed over or not reported, which would be very useful to readers. Some of these might require additional work, but others should be readily available from what the authors have done already. For example, the discussion of the simulation results was very cursory. Likewise, although the authors allude to the computational demands of their RSM approach, it would be useful to quantify exactly what these demands are, for example by providing an estimate of how long some fixed number of analyses, involving some number of stimuli or number of TRs, takes on a particular system with particular specs. Among information that might require additional analyses but would be useful to researchers, the most pressing need relates to defining what “completely unique stimulus set” means—that is, is there some parametric relationship between the degree to which each participant’s stimulus set is unique and how suboptimal the standard fixed-effect approach is? E.g., in a study of 30 participants, is it unique enough if each participant sees a random subset of 99% of the stimuli in some larger corpus? 75%? 50%? The last concern has to do with being careful in defining the scope of the proposed RSM approach. While the entire paper reflects the high degree of importance the authors place on drawing valid inferences, we nonetheless felt that the section “Stimulus-level parameter estimates as a tool for explanation” should emphasize the need for caution to an even greater degree than it already does. This is a particularly exciting possible application of the approach, but it is also one that seems particularly prone to abuse, especially by researchers who are looking for an upside to counteract the “downside” of smaller effect sizes that this approach will bring. The authors are obviously statistically sophisticated enough that they leave implicit the dangers associated with this sort of exploratory approach; they should be explicit.We have read this submission.

The paper conveys an important message, which has been completely overlooked in the neuroimaging field to date and is likely to become influential over time, especially as practical guidelines are provided and the code has been made publicly available. We have a number of queries and suggestions detailed below:Main points:Introduction There appear to be two related issues in the paper: one is not modelling structured noise in the data, inflating standardised effects; this is the case when comparing the standard model which doesn’t model stimulus variability to the RSM and other models. This may be wrong even in the situation where the researcher was agnostic as to whether the results apply in general to categories of stimuli or just the stimuli tested. The second issue is fixed versus random effect modelling of the stimuli which is presented as the main focus of the paper. If this is the case, it might be worth making the distinction clearer. It would be beneficial to introduce to the reader that you will focus on a particular example in your result sections, e.g., amygdala response to emotional faces; it was slightly surprising to us when we approached the Results section.Methods In the simulations, is stimulus-to-stimulus variability kept constant across subjects? The ground truth of this isn’t known, but is this plausible? What is the effect of relaxing this, is it similar to increasing the number of stimuli tested? How does it interact with the number of participants and inflation of standardised effects? It would be helpful to justify this and consider its implications in the discussion. P.2 | Section fMRI dataset: Please list the tasks and specific contrasts you chose from the HCP dataset to be included in your analyses as it seems that you focused on a sub-selection (Figure 4 and Figure 6). While all information are mentioned in the text, it might be clearer to create a table summarizing sample size and number of stimuli for each dataset (not just HCP) or include this information in the two figures, n=Y, and m=X. P. 5| Section Simulations: You mention that you fitted four different models, which are also explained in detail in the Supplementary File you provide. However, it would be helpful to state in the main text that the standard model, the fixed stimulus model, and the random stimulus model are implemented as Bayesian models to facilitate comparison (as differences in results can be solely linked to the inclusion of no, fixed, or random stimulus effects in the model), while the SPM model is used to compare results against the main software in the field (but here the implementations differs).Results Some explicit details about the computational demand for model fitting would be interesting to provide.Discussion  The empirical studies used for comparison had sample sizes N=100, N=72, and N=11. The study with the small sample size (N=11) however included many different stimuli types (M=60). In this respect, no study was included that had a sample size commonly found in the field (N=20-30) while also having a relatively small number of stimuli as also common in the field as outlined in your Introduction. This kind of study though would have been the best when making inferences about a “large fraction of the results reported in the fMRI literature”. Considering that the problem of reduction in standardized effects is the highest for studies with large sample sizes, the conclusion that a “large fraction of the results reported in the fMRI literature are likely to be severely inflated” (p.11) may be too strong given the empirical studies employed for this study. You may want to discuss that when the data contained zero stimulus variability, the RSM model yielded attenuated effects compared to the standard model (by 18%) for small stimulus sample size. While this may not be of practical relevance (as zero stimulus variability is highly unlikely), it would be important to reflect on this from a statistical point of view. Are there other similar effects that might be affecting the FMRI literature? For example, what about stimulus presentation order? Both cognitive and neural processes likely have a large systematic temporal effect. Despite having large influence on the BOLD signal, this is normally not modelled, and so could also affect standardised effect sizes and interpretation. It may not be comparable, but it might be worth speculating on other potential problems, which could have similar effect, such as temporal order, in the discussion. Currently, you take a statistician’s point of view as the main focus of the paper. However, one potential implication of the work that could be discussed is that stimuli selection based on classic psychology theory may be not completely accurate. For example, while it could be that psychology informed stimuli selection would group stimulus A and stimulus B in the same category, they may not be represented in the brain that way; the  neural system may be  more sensitive to stimuli perturbations than could be assessed using 'traditional' psychological tools (derived from questionnaire or behavioural data). Equally, different representations of stimuli in the brain could result in similar behavioural responses. This points towards the need for a neurally-informed cognitive taxonomy rather than relying purely on psychological definitions, that were developed largely blind to the underlying functional organisation of the brain.

In this paper, the authors claim that the conclusions of several studies would be modified if a statistical models taking into account the variability of the presented stimuli had been considered. Although the problem is interesting, I am not completely convinced by the conclusions and the statistical tools used to assess the results. First of all, the authors argue that, due to the complexity of the new model, the authors can not use the standard numerical tools to perform the statistical inference (R or SAS) and so will prefer a Bayesian inference, making this choice quite opportunist. We regret that the choice to use a Bayesian model created confusion.  We noted in the Methods section that the fMRI random stimulus model “cannot be fit using standard mixed modeling statistical packages, such as lme4 in R or SAS PROC MIXED, because these packages assume that each row of the dataset is associated with one and only one level of each random factor, i.e., a single participant and a single stimulus.” Hence, we were forced to develop a custom model, and a Bayesian one developed with PyMC3 was the most convenient approach. We note that most of the datasets we analyzed could in principle also have been fitted using a modified (and approximate) version of the standard “summary statistics” model; however, this would have required extensive additional analysis, as we would have needed to fit a separate first-level model for each individual subject (adding individual regressors for each individual stimulus and temporarily omitting existing condition regressors, which in the classical formulation are non-identifiable in the presence of the stimulus effects); and then fit a mixed model at the second level that models the individual stimulus effects as random effects. The former steps would have been extremely time-consuming relative to our strategy of fitting a single large model, and the latter step (i.e., modeling stimulus as a random effect) is currently not supported in any existing fMRI package, so we would have had to develop a custom model anyway. Moreover, as we noted in the supplement, “This [summary statistics] model is only an approximate version of the full RSM, as it ignores the varying degrees of uncertainty in the stimulus-level coefficients estimated at the first level (due in particular to factors such as differences in how often the stimuli were presented and how collinear the stimulus-level regressors were for each subject)”. We also note that we did in fact use the summary statistics approximation to obtain estimates for the Chang et al. (2015) dataset (see supplement for details). This was not by choice, and we would have preferred to fit the full RSM; however, as we explain in the supplement, this dataset was available in a form amenable only to the summary statistics approach (i.e., because pre-computed estimates for each individual trial were provided).
However, besides the fact that they use a Bayesian inference (including prior distribution), they base their conclusions on frequentist arguments (comparing test statistics). To my point of view, this is quite confusing. We do not believe that our conclusions are based on frequentist arguments. Notably, we have not computed any p-values nor refer to any z-scores.  In the section “Does the amygdala preferentially respond to emotional faces?” we write: “we define a test statistic z = µ/σ, where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the posterior samples for the associated parameter estimate”. The use of “test statistic” was a bit careless, as we are not “testing hypotheses”; we simply needed a convenient summary of the posterior.  We admit that this choice of terminology could be confusing, so in our revision we have renamed this statistic the posterior standardized effect. Another important point is that our argument is fundamentally qualitative and not quantitative; we focus on how uncertainty surrounding the estimate of interest (denominator of our standardized effect) increases dramatically in most cases. We present this increase in terms of standardized effect because that’s what most people are familiar with, but nothing would change if we instead talked about the relative increases in the variances of the estimates.
If a Bayesian framework is considered, then the hypothesis testings should be perform using Bayes Factor or any other tools taking into account the prior distribution. Bayes Factors in this setting are not trivial, and any rate would not serve the broad audience, who would like to know:  How severe is the random stimulus effect problem?  Again, we could have measured this directly in terms of variance inflation, but since users are most familiar with signal-to-noise ratio, we felt that this was the best metric.
Moreover, when proposing a new model, the first thing to do is to  compare the old model and the new model for any given dataset (using statistical tools such as hypothesis testing, in a frequentist or Bayesian framework). I could not see such a test in the paper. The mixed effects model involves much more parameters for the same amount of observations. Before deriving conclusions on the new model, it should be interesting to put in competition the fixed effects model and the mixed effects models, to be sure that the use of the more complex model is supported by the data. The reviewer is correct that no formal model assessment was used. This was intentional, as (crucially) we are not testing a hypothesis about the relative fit of different models.  Rather, we’re pointing out a fundamental mismatch between the conclusions researchers typically draw (which almost invariably involve assuming that it is safe to generalize conclusions over a population of stimuli) and the inferences that are actually licensed by the statistical model (which, in the absence of a variance component reflecting the random sampling of levels from some factor, are only valid for the specific levels used in the experiment). Our position is that it is the design of the experiment and the goals of the analyst--not the observed data--that determine which random effects should be included in the model. This position is consistent with the arguments of Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily (2013). It may be useful to draw an analogy to a random subject effect in a multi-subject model.  No reasonable investigator would test for the significance (or BF-based evidence) for a subject random effect; while such tests may come up negative sometimes, we know our subjects are a random sample from a larger population, a population to which we wish to generalise.  Likewise, it is now generally accepted that meta-analyses should treat study as a random effect irrespective of formal tests of heterogeneity (Borenstein, et al., 2010). Hence our paper is not focused on the question “Is there statistical evidence for random stimulus effects?” but rather the assertion “Some stimuli are random, and such stimuli should be so modeled.”  This is a widely noted point in many other disciplines, as we have referenced in the introduction; our contribution is to raise awareness of this issue in neuroimaging, and provide easy-to-interpret measures of the impact of neglecting random stimulus effects.
Besides, in a Bayesian context, the greater posterior variance observed on the regression parameters was completely expected (Figure 2) (more parameters for the same quantity of information leads to more incertitude a posteriori). Our reanalysis of the Emotion Regulation dataset and our simulation results both speak to the contrary. The Emotion regulation dataset featured a relatively large number of stimuli with small estimated stimulus variance; consequently the standardized effects (what we called the test statistics in the manuscript) from the RSM and standard models are essentially identical, despite the fact that the RSM technically contains many more parameters. Consistent with this general finding, in the Method subsection describing our simulation results we wrote: “When the true data generating process contained zero stimulus variability, the standard model and RSM yielded very similar [standardized effects] for the stimulus category difference, for all participant and stimulus sample sizes. The exception was that when the stimulus sample size was small (m = 16), the [standardized effects] from the RSM were slightly attenuated (by about 18%) compared to the standard model [standardized effects]. However, this attenuation disappeared with increasing stimulus sample size, so that at m = 32 and m = 64, the [standardized effects] from the two models were essentially identical, as should be the case given the lack of true stimulus variability.” Note that as the stimulus sample size increases, the number of parameters in the RSM technically increases as well, but this actually causes the posterior for the category difference to become more narrow, not more wide. We believe that these analyses sufficiently highlight the conditions under which the RSM does and does not give overly pessimistic posterior estimates of the category difference.
However, without objective criteria (such as Bayes factor or hypothesis testing), I am not able to decide whether the difference between fear faces and anger faces is significant or not. (caption for Figure 2). It is not clearly stated in the paper how the authors were able to do so (even though I could find clues in the simulation section?).   We were careful not to claim that the difference was or was not statistically significant, but rather, that there appears to be at most a small effect. In Bayesian estimation terms, this amounts to saying that the posterior distributions for the effects of fearful and angry faces mostly overlap. We have updated the text to clarify these points (see updated section beginning with “Depending on one’s statistical approach and assumptions…”).
I am aware of the fact that Bayes factor are quantities difficult to estimate and that frequentist hypothesis testing in mixed effects models can be a tough issue. However, if the authors want to prove that the conclusions of statistical testing are modified when using mixed effects models, then they should perform the adequate and rigorous statistical testings. As expanded on above, we do not think model comparison is necessary or helpful in this context. Our argument is not predicated on the idea that a model with random stimulus effects fits the data better (although we strongly suspect that it often will), but rather on how the experimental design and the desired inferences demand such a model.

th critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction (CASP11)” by Belsom et al. describes a blind study to test a hybrid approach using cross-linking/mass spectrometry and ab initio modeling (CASP11) in structure prediction. The hybrid approach was proven to be successful on a mostly a-helical protein (HSA) previously published by the group. The new study with 4 proteins from a structural genomics center shows that the CLMS data provide limited or no improvement in modeling accuracy by CASP11. The authors attribute the difference to two major factors. One is the uneven sequence coverage by trypsin (solvable) and the other is the predominant b-sheet structure in the target proteins as opposed to mostly helical structure in HSA. While one of the proteins does have high percentage of the residues in b-sheet (54%), the other two analyzed in the paper have 22 and 37% of the residues in b-strand structure. If the method does not work with these mixed a/b proteins, it will require some major improvement to be effective in structure predication. It should be emphasized in fact that the negative results seen here outline the specific milestones that have to be overcome.      Other flaws in the manuscript:
One protein, TX781, was possibly damaged during shipping, as indicated by the authors.

 Figure 5 shows the distribution of GDT_TS scores for decoys generated by RBO ALEPH without constraints, and with cross links for all four CASP11 cross-linking targets. The GDT_TS of the best model found in CASP11 is also shown in the figure which is relatively quite high for few cases. These results give an impression that the computational method used here is not the best method available because authors claimed that the CLMS data only slightly improved the GDT_TS of the predicted models from 36.4 to 38.1 for the first models and from 40.9 to 42.0 for the best-of-five models.From the viewpoint of generating protein 3D models in the consistent manner with given cross-linking data, authors should perform analysis on all the CASP11 submitted 3D models for 4 Tx targets (7 domains) to observe the correlation between the model’s consistency with cross-linking data and the model’s GDT-TS score. Is the higher GDT-TS score 3D models submitted by other CASP11 groups more consistent with cross-linking data? Or, are there 3D models more consistent with cross-linking data but with lower GDT-TS scores? Minors:
In the data analysis section, what is PSM? How did the author conclude that the residue pair score is equal to square root of PSM score?Both in Table 1 and 2, no data is available for Tx767 for the 10% FDR case. Why?The data set contains only four proteins and the authors did not find good agreement between the photo–CLMS and crystallography data for Tx781. In addition, Tx808 10% FDR data is missing. What is the rationale of the author’s conclusion that “
we find good agreement between photo- CLMS and crystallography in this blind study”?What is the reason to choose the upper bound distance of 25 Å? There may exist cross–links with longer than 25 Å and these cross-links data can also improve the results.

 et al. is an important benchmark in two ways:
It generalizes the results of semi-specific cross-linking they obtained last year on a single protein (HSA) to a larger set of proteins. Moreover, these are more challenging proteins with more complex folds. They were also supplied under different conditions from external labs.  The new results clearly show that semi-specific cross-linking is increasing the number of identified cross-links by up to ten folds compared to numbers usually observed by fully specific cross-linking reagents.  This puts HD-CLMS as an important advance for the CLMS methodology.Because the described work was part of the CASP11 prediction experiment, the current effectiveness of the HD-CLMS data for structure prediction is assessed. It is very surprising that the data only improved predictions by very slight amount. In my opinion, the authors have correctly described some of the reasons for this lack of improvement. It highlights the need of the structure prediction community to find better approaches to utilize the data.  The manuscript is very well written and clear. I have only two minor comments: a. In the legend of Fig. 3b – I think the writing should be “cross-linking distances under 25Angs” and not “over 25Angs”. b. At the top of page 9 the authors refer to “uncertainty in the site assignment”. I assume it means the uncertainty in the exact residue to which the diazarine is cross-linked to.

NA,NA,Kassiotis,George,NA,"The Francis Crick Institute, UK",NA,"We wish to thank the Reviewers for their astute and constructive comments. Below is a point-by-point reply and a list of changes we have made to the manuscript in response to these comments:Major comments: 1.We agree with the Reviewer that peptide alterations could affect the peptide-MHC-II complex (pMHC) itself, not only TCR binding to it. Our definition of TCR-pMHC interaction was meant to be broad enough to include effects on pMHC formation. Obviously, anything that affects pMHC formation or stability will also affect TCR-pMHC interaction, by reducing ligand availability. All these alternatives are on the same side of the argument, the other side being biological activity of the immunosuppressive domain. We have modified this sentence to read: “…at the level of pMHC formation or TCR-pMHC interaction.” 2. “Scrambled” peptides are permutation of the original peptide sequence. The rationale for using them is that they would retain the physico-chemical characteristics (molecular mass, polarity, acidity, etc), but not any sequence-dependent domain, structure or recognition motif. Practically, these were constructed using the peptide manufacturer’s (GeneScript) algorithms. The peptides were all sufficiently hydrophobic to dissolve in PBS. This was chosen in order to avoid any effect of organic solvents. 3. Again we agree with the Reviewer and rephrased this sentence to read: “…in some pMHC combinations or TCR-pMHC pairs, but not others”. Given what is known about peptide-flanking residues and their effect on pMHC formation and stability and TCR binding, the results might not be unexpected. In fact, we believe this is the most parsimonious explanation for the effects of the putative immunosuppressive domain, one that needs not invoke any new biological activity or mechanism.Minor comments: 1. The word “comprising” in this context was meant to be synonymous with “including” or “containing”. The word “within” would have the opposite meaning. The immunosuppressive domain is within the antigenic peptides, not the reverse. 2. The shading has been replaced with red colour text for enhanced contrast. 3. These peptides were used for the experiments described in Supplementary figure 1. 4. The env124-138 and ova323-339-env548-567 peptides were used as separate entities, not as a fusion.

Using well-adapted methods, they fully described acquisition of the foamy macrophage phenotype and impact of NPC treatment of mycobacteria growth. Taken together, these data provide a well performed description of macrophage lipid alteration during mycobacteria infection and the potential target of this pathway as host targeted therapy that would be of interest for the scientific community working on NPC or mycobacteria. The text is well written and clear, the methods are exhaustive, presentation of the results clear while the discussion is quite long. I would suggest the author to shorten the discussion in order to focus on the main message of the paper. Major comments that must be addressed before indexation of the manuscript:
Figure 1 describe the acquisition of the NPC phenotype by macrophages infected by mycobacteria. Infection with different Multiplicity of Infection and different time points should be included and the results compared with positive control of NPC cells as this phenotype is not well known by the scientific community working on mycobacteria and that will read with interest this article. The authors should clarify at least in the text why the experiments are performed at different time point between the data presented in Figure 1.Quantifications should be included in Figure 1G and L, Figure 2B to F and I-J, Figure 3B.Only single cells are shown to illustrate the foamy phenotype, authors should show lower scale pictures illustrating larger fields of the experiments instead of a single cell.My main concern is the way mycobacteria clearance is measured. Fluorescent microscopy do not allow to conclude on bacteria clearance. Colony forming unit assay should be used after infection to concluded on bacteria clearance or the text should be changed accordingly as the difference in number of bacteria in cells can reflect differences in bacteria binding and phagocytosis by macrophages or a slower growth rate.Similarly in Figure 4, bacterial content is measured by flow cytometry using 2 different MOI. The authors should justify why they used 2 different MOI (10 and 100) in Figure 4B and MPOI 12.5 in Figure 2C. They should also show the SSC/FSC dot plots and the gating strategy they used to obtain the histogram shown in B. As they used high MOI such as 100, they should also provide evidence on how they evaluate macrophage cell death in their experiments. Using the histogram, data should be calculated as % of infected cells instead of MFI of the global fluorescence.Data obtained by flow cytometry illustrate the fluorescence content of infected macrophages. The authors claim that drugs induce mycobacteria clearance. Difference in fluorescence may reflect a bacteriostatic effect of the drugs on mycobacteria growth. CFU experiments should be done to conclude on bacteria clearance or the text should be modified accordingly to avoid over-interpretation of the experiments. Minor points:
Scale bars must be included in the pictures when missing (Figure 1B, Figure 2B-D-J, Figure 3E, Figure 4G).Authors should show level of grey pictures and merge as red and blue colours are not visible on the black background.Figure 4G, time point should be included, Figure 4H, illustration of mycobacteria content in zebrafish should be included.Figure 4E should be shown in 4B with the corresponding absolute values instead of the normalization of the control to 1.Figure 3E, in the legend, “peritoneal macrophages” is indicated while “bone-marrow derived macrophages” is written in the text.

I would suggest the author to shorten the discussion in order to focus on the main message of the paper.” We thank the reviewer for her comments, and accept that the discussion is quite long. However, the discussion is attempting to bridge two previously unconnected fields of research so may require more detail than is usual. We have attempted to shorten the discussion, but found it difficult to do so without detracting from the main message of the paper.“Figure 1 describe the acquisition of the NPC phenotype by macrophages infected by mycobacteria. Infection with different Multiplicity of Infection and different time points should be included and the results compared with positive control of NPC cells as this phenotype is not well known by the scientific community working on mycobacteria and that will read with interest this article. The authors should clarify at least in the text why the experiments are performed at different time point between the data presented in Figure 1.” We thank the reviewer for her comments, and have added macrophages with pharmacologically induced NPC phenotypes cells as positive controls in Fig. 1Fi, as well as adding in text to the Figure 1 results section referencing previous experiments performed looking at lipid accumulation and intracellular calcium levels in
Npc1 mutant cells and in those in which NPC phenotypes have been pharmacologically induced.“Quantifications should be included in Figure 1G and L, Figure 2B to F and I-J, Figure 3B.” We kindly direct the reviewer to our response to Reviewer 2’s comment regarding quantification.“Only single cells are shown to illustrate the foamy phenotype, authors should show lower scale pictures illustrating larger fields of the experiments instead of a single cell” We thank the reviewer for her suggestion, and have added lower magnification images that show larger fields of cells demonstrating the foamy phenotype occurring post-BCG infection (Fig. 2 panel F).“My main concern is the way mycobacteria clearance is measured. Fluorescent microscopy do not allow to conclude on bacteria clearance. Colony forming unit assay should be used after infection to concluded on bacteria clearance or the text should be changed accordingly as the difference in number of bacteria in cells can reflect differences in bacteria binding and phagocytosis by macrophages or a slower growth rate.” We thank the reviewer for her comments. We certainly agree that the colony forming unit assay would be a worthwhile experiment, and will carry it out in the near future. We accept that host cell fluorescence is only indicative of infection level, and have stated this in the text. However, it should be noted that the experiments looking at NPC therapies (Fig 4) were performed in such a way that therapies were only applied to infected cells
after the initial infection stage. Host cells were incubated with mycobacteria in the absence of drug for 48 hours in order to establish infection. The bacteria-containing media was then removed and the coverslips washed thoroughly, before adding media either with or without NPC therapies. This fresh media did not contain bacteria. The only bacteria remaining are those that were bound and internalized by macrophages
before the addition of drug. It is true that differences in host cell fluorescence post-treatment may be due to the drug affecting the growth rate of intracellular mycobacteria, and not due to the effect of the drug on bacterial clearance. However, this would not be resolved by the colony forming assay.“Similarly in Figure 4, bacterial content is measured by flow cytometry using 2 different MOI. The authors should justify why they used 2 different MOI (10 and 100) in Figure 4B and MPOI 12.5 in Figure 2C. They should also show the SSC/FSC dot plots and the gating strategy they used to obtain the histogram shown in B. As they used high MOI such as 100, they should also provide evidence on how they evaluate macrophage cell death in their experiments. Using the histogram, data should be calculated as % of infected cells instead of MFI of the global fluorescence.” The use of MOI 10 and MOI 100 in Fig 4B is used to highlight that increased levels of infection with fluorescent mycobacteria results in host cells with increased fluorescence, which can be detected via flow cytometry. The effect of NPC therapies on host cell fluorescence, indicative of intracellular mycobacterial load, was assessed using the same MOI (12.5) that we had used earlier in the paper. We have added text in the manuscript (in the section ‘Results – NPC Therapeutics Promote Clearance of Pathogenic Mycobacteria’) to emphasize this. Regarding calculating data as percentage of infected cell instead of MFI of global fluorescence: the difficulty with this method of data analysis is that in an infected population of cells, not each host cell is infected equally. Microscopy-based methods demonstrated that within the population some cells avoided infection completely, some were lightly infected (<5 bacteria per host cell), with some having a much greater mycobacterial burden. If the MOI was increased then the average number of bacteria per cell also increased, but there was still variability in infection level across the cell population. Flow cytometry based methods did not give a clearly delineated ‘uninfected’ and ‘infected’ peak. Rather, as the histogram in Fig 4Bi demonstrates, there is a peak representing uninfected or lightly infected cells and then a broad shoulder to that peak representing cells of increasing infectious load. It is possible to attempt to divide the histogram into ‘uninfected’ and ‘infected’ cells. During our preliminary experiments we did investigate using this form of data analysis versus analysis of MFI of global fluorescence. We found that whilst both methods of analysis resulted in the same conclusions, attempting to divide the cell population into ‘uninfected’ and ‘infected’ required a decision to be made on the part of the researcher as to where this division should occur, therefore leading to potential subjectivity. On these grounds we proceeded to analyze our data in terms of MFI of global fluorescence.“Data obtained by flow cytometry illustrate the fluorescence content of infected macrophages. The authors claim that drugs induce mycobacteria clearance. Difference in fluorescence may reflect a bacteriostatic effect of the drugs on mycobacteria growth.

The results have important implications that link rare lysosomal storage disorders and tuberculosis. Experiments are very detailed, well executed and conclusions justified. Unfortunately, the authors only speculate that mycobacterial lipids can potentially inhibit NPC1 because it seems technically difficult to test. This hypothesis is definitely of interest. Minor suggestions for improvement in general are:
Larger images are needed in general, they are too small and it is very difficult to observe what the authors are describing.

In support of this idea, the authors show that infection with pathogenic mycobacteria or treatment with their cell wall lipids results in a number of cellular phenotypes that also occur as a result of NPC1 deficiency. These include disrupted intracellular trafficking of lipids including GM1, sphinogomyelin and LacCer, increased filipin staining, and decreased GPN-releasable lysosomal Ca2+. Additional data show that NPC1 gene dosage affects the occurrence of these phenotypes. While the aggregate evidence supports the occurrence of similar cellular phenotypes in NPC disease and following mycobacterial infection, the authors do not show direct functional inhibition of NPC1 protein, as suggested at several points in the manuscript including the abstract, Fig 3 title and discussion. In fact, they comment in the discussion that they are not able to show direct interaction of myobacterial lipids/glycomycolates with NPC1, raising the possibility of other cellular targets. Indeed, it is well known that defects in unrelated genes (for example, SMPD1) can cause many of these same cellular phenotypes. Therefore, greater caution in interpreting the target that triggers the demonstrated effects is warranted. The observation that curcumin promotes mycobacterial clearance is of interest. Curcumin is a natural product with multiple suggested intracellular targets. If it is acting on ER Ca2+ stores by inhibiting SERCA channels to trigger this effect, then complementary experiments using more specific small molecules and/or genetic approaches would strengthen this conclusion. It would be helpful to include Npc1 deficient macrophages as a comparison in a few experiments in Fig 1 so as to inform the reader the extent to which changes following mycobacterial infection are quantitatively similar. Much of the data in Fig 2 are representative images. Quantification from replicate experiments would be helpful. Similarly, quantification should be included in Fig 3B. Several figures are missing scale bars (1B, 2B, 2D, 4G). It’s difficult to appreciate the cellular structures that are stained by filipin after mycobacterial infection.

Indeed, due to the lack of a reliable binding assay for NPC1 interactions, and lack of a direct functional assay (with the function of the NPC1 protein remaining contentious), the evidence that it is the NPC1 protein that is targeted during infection/lipid treatment is necessarily indirect. However, the fact that mycobacterial infection/lipid treatment induces the range of phenotypes present in NPC cells (the combination of which is unique to NPC cells) and that susceptibility to phenotype induction is inversely proportional to levels of NPC1 protein present supports a model in which it is the NPC1 protein that is the target during infection/lipid treatment.“The observation that curcumin promotes mycobacterial clearance is of interest. Curcumin is a natural product with multiple suggested intracellular targets. If it is acting on ER Ca2+ stores by inhibiting SERCA channels to trigger this effect, then complementary experiments using more specific small molecules and/or genetic approaches would strengthen this conclusion.” We thank the reviewer for his comments. Indeed, curcumin has been implicated to be acting on multiple intracellular targets. Here we demonstrate that high-purity curcumin modulates host cell calcium, leading to an increase in cytosolic calcium and a decrease in endoplasmic reticular calcium. A related compound (tetramethylcurcumin) has no effect on calcium. The ability of a curcuminoid to modulate host cell calcium correlated with its ability to reduce intracellular mycobacterial load. Crucially, the ability of curcumin to reduce intracellular mycobacterial load was abrogated by presence of the Ca
2+-chelator BAPTA. This supports a model in which it is the modulation of calcium which is key to curcumin’s action.“It would be helpful to include Npc1 deficient macrophages as a comparison in a few experiments in Fig 1 so as to inform the reader the extent to which changes following mycobacterial infection are quantitatively similar.” We thank the reviewer for his suggestion, and have added macrophages with pharmacologically induced NPC phenotypes cells as positive controls in Fig. 1Fi, as well as adding in text to the Figure 1 results section referencing previous experiments performed looking at lipid accumulation and intracellular calcium levels in

I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.,31,1,2017,2017-1-31,PMC5218543,Study Protocol,28066825,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10005.2,A blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy of morphine analgesia for procedural pain in infants: Trial protocol.,2016-11-15,research-article; journal article;

In the description of the protocol all the elements are appropriately addressed but the main underlying question is whether there is validity in taking such an approach. Literature data even today have shown that preterms in the ICU are submitted to on average 10 painful events without appropriate procedural analgesia. To this effect a number of procedures have been evaluated as recently by Carbajal
 et al using an enquiry in many neonatal intensive care units and the use of analgesic and sedative drugs as published in the Lancet 2015. There is a significant variability in the use of different analgesics and the optimal analgesic so far is not available for practice in daily NICU care. Apart from a variety of non-pharmacological approaches, including swaddling and kangarooing, pharmacological approaches can be divided in opioid and non-opioids while the latter can either be used as long or short working analgesic drugs. Morphine is a classic example of a drug that does not have an immediate effect and as such the trial design is appropriate as the drug is given about 1 hour before the procedure. This kind of approach has been used before for endotracheal intubation based on the concept that intubation is a painful event which is mainly derived on experiences and questionnaires from adults. Given the pharmacokinetic characteristics of morphine its mode of action and the slow time of onset it is very questionable whether this approach of evaluating oral morphine for procedural pain in infants is of value for our understanding and will change our attitude towards procedures like evaluation of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP screening and heel lancing). In fact a short working opioid related substance like fentanyl of one of the modern forms of fentanyl like- substances needs a higher urgency of evaluation than going back to a classic drug like morphine of which many clinicians will not be considering to give it 1 hour before a screening procedure. Moreover there is a lack of data on the oral consumption and absorption of morphine which can lead to a significant feeling of doubt of the relevance of this approach. Although I appreciate the detailed way of the protocol description in which all the elements are nicely documented and reported in a structured way the fundamental question whether this research is relevant for this vulnerable group of patients is arguable. My opinion is supported by 2 experts in evaluation of pain the newborn as well as a neonatologist – clinical pharmacologist who I consulted within this process of writing this comment.I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.",16,1,2017,2017-1-16,PMC5218543,Study Protocol,28066825,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10005.2,A blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy of morphine analgesia for procedural pain in infants: Trial protocol.,2016-11-15,research-article; journal article; 
NA,NA,Slater,Rebeccah,NA,University of Oxford,NA,"We would like to thank Dr Tibboel for reading and reviewing our Trial Protocol. In his report Dr Tibboel suggests that although the study is well designed and described, he is not convinced that a study of this type is warranted to test the analgesic efficacy of morphine for procedural pain in prematurely born infants. We strongly disagree with this sentiment. If the results of this clinical trial were to show that the administration of a single oral bolus dose of morphine prior to retinopathy of prematurity screening (ROP) decreases noxious-evoked bran activity, reduces clinical pain scores, and prevents physiological instability that is reported to occur in the 24-hour period post ROP screening (characterised by an increase in the rates of apnoea, tachycardia, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation), there would be a strong rationale for its use in clinical practice. This is particularly important given that current treatment options for this procedure are not considered to provide adequate analgesia. Furthermore, if the administration of oral morphine prior to painful procedures is shown to be effective, it may also be useful for other painful procedures, and would increase the treatment options available to infants. The fact that it would need to be given an hour before a scheduled procedure should not negate its value. While morphine may be a ‘classic drug’ that is commonly administered to ventilated infants in intensive care, its primary use in this population is as a sedative and there is still controversy regarding its analgesic efficacy (as described in Dr Carbajal’s Referee Report). If the dose proposed here is effective this will also add considerably to the limited dosing data available for oral morphine. Furthermore, inclusion of our more recently developed measures of pain-related brain activity and the detailed physiological monitoring will add greatly to our mechanistic understanding of how pharmacological analgesics alter brain activity and physiological stability in prematurely-born infants. While we agree that it would also be valuable to use a similar approach to test the analgesic efficacy of fentanyl (which we are in the process of setting up), this does not negate the importance of testing the analgesic efficacy of morphine for procedural pain.",18,1,2017,2017-1-18,PMC5218543,Study Protocol,28066825,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10005.2,A blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy of morphine analgesia for procedural pain in infants: Trial protocol.,2016-11-15,research-article; journal article; 
Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.10781.r18752,Carbajal,Ricardo,NA,"1Center for Research on Epidemiology, Paris-Descartes University, Paris, France",approve,"This is the protocol of a blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized, phase II, clinical trial that will be undertaken to determine whether morphine sulphate administered orally prior to clinically-required retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening and heel lancing provides effective analgesia. A total of 156 infants between 34 and 42 weeks’ corrected gestational age who require a clinical heel lance and ROP screening on the same test occasion will be included in the trial. Infants will be randomised to receive either a single dose of morphine sulphate (100 μg/kg) or placebo. Each infant will be monitored for 48 hours and safety data will be collected during the 24 hours following drug administration. The primary outcome will be the Premature Infant Pain Profile–revised (PIPP-R) score during the 30-seconds period after ROP screening. The co-primary outcome will be the magnitude of nociceptive-specific brain activity evoked by a clinically-required heel lance. This is a very relevant study because it aims at finding an effective analgesic strategy to reduce pain during ROP screening since no analgesic approach so far published seems adequate. Furthermore, it will contribute to obtain evidence of the analgesic efficacy of morphine in the neonate for procedural pain. Conflicting evidence exists about the efficacy of continuous morphine to relieve pain from routine procedures in ventilated preterm neonates. Two studies investigated their responses to tracheal suctioning
1,2; in one of them, Anand
et al found a reduction in pain scores
2, whereas Simons
et al, judging from pain scores obtained with three validated scales, found no difference between morphine and placebo groups
1. Pain measured by facial expression was diminished by morphine infusions during heel stick in preterm and term neonates, but pain measures did not correlate with plasma morphine concentrations
3. In another study, morphine given as a loading dose followed by continuous intravenous infusions to less than 48-hours old ventilated neonates under 33 weeks gestation did not appear to provide adequate analgesia for the acute pain caused by a heel stick
4. Thus, the use of two different procedures as well as the use of two different ways of assessing pain in the current study will contribute to a better understanding of the analgesic efficacy of morphine in neonates. Of note, at the time of the study intervention, neonates will be at least two weeks old and between 34 and 42 corrected gestational age. The close follow-up during 48 hours after the painful procedure is a major asset. The protocol is very well written and interventions are very clearly and repeatedly explained. The background section provides enough information to understand the importance of this study and the rationale of using these two procedures. The trial design section shows in the text and in the corresponding figure a clear outline of planned interventions. The safety monitoring section is complete and gives clear indications of the assessments and reporting of adverse effects. The statistical analyses are well presented and data management procedures seem very relevant.Specific comments on sectionsBackground and rationale Page 3. The explanation of the distress caused by ROP needs, in my opinion, to be clarified. When citing Mitchell
 et al (Ref 14), it is said that the level of clinical distress caused by this procedure is exemplified in a recent study, which reports that in the 24-hour period following ROP screening 41% of infants have apneic episodes compared to only 19% after the examination. In fact, this information does not seem to correspond to what is mentioned in the article which indicates an apnea frequency of 12.8% before eye examination, 23.07% within the first 24 hours after eye examination (p=0.13) and 30.7% from 25-48 hours after eye examination (p=0.04). Page 3. If the described plausibility that the administration of morphine prior to ROP screening may provide effective pain relief and consequently reduce the resultant physiological instability caused by the procedure is true, one interpretation would be that this procedure elicits a long lasting pain because of the tissue damage or inflammation that may be created by the long lasting insertion of a speculum that pulls apart the eyelids. Page 4. While the use of nociceptive-specific brain activity may allow identifying patterns of nociceptive brain activity, it should be kept in mind during the discussion and interpretation of results that pain is a very complex phenomenon that could not be reduced to a very short lasting electrical activity. In a previous paper of the authors, this brain activity that lasted less than 100 milliseconds was used as a primary outcome to assess the analgesic efficacy of an oral sweet solution. In the current study, the authors will use again an immediate nociceptive electrical signal during a heel lance but also measure pain with a pain scale after the end of ROP screening. These two types of assessments seem complementary. Page 4. In the justification of the trial, the statement on the use of a dose of 200 µg/kg of oral morphine does not correspond to the cited reference (Ref 37).Trial design Page 5. In box 1 and throughout the text, the description of the moment of the pain assessment for ROP screening is a bit confusing. It is said that pain will be assessed with the PIPP-R score 30 seconds after ROP screening. It would be more appropriate to say that pain will be assessed during the 30-seconds period after ROP screening. Page 5. Box 1, secondary outcome measures. The measurement of the incidence of apnea is only relevant for non-intubated infants. This should be clarified because nowhere in the protocol it is indicated that intubated infants will not be included. The use of an inotrope as a marker of hypotension requiring intervention is in my opinion insufficient because in many occasions the first intervention for morphine-induced hypotension will be volume replacement. Thus, this volume replacement should also be monitored and reported. Page 6. Inclusion-exclusion criteria. It should be clarified that intubated and non-intubated infants will be included. Page 7. Figure 2. In the exclusion criteria box, correct “…born to mothers who regularly used opiates…” Page 11. Reflex withdrawal. Reference 38 does not correspond to this statement; it should be reference numbered 37. Page 11. Safety of administration of oral morphine. As indicated above the incidence of apnea is only relevant to non-intubated infants. Page 12. Concomitant medications. The assertion “At present infants do not receive any pain medication prior to heel lancing so it is acceptable that the control group receive a placebo (inactive solution) with no medicinal effects.” Is not true everywhere. Indeed, the opposite is becoming true. Guidelines for managing painful procedures in different countries indicate the use of sucrose for heel lance. For instance a joint position statement from the Canadian Paediatric Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that a combination of oral sucrose/glucose and other nonpharmacological pain reduction methods (nonnutritive sucking, kangaroo care, facilitated tuck, swaddling and developmental care) should be used for minor, routine procedures
5; this recommendation was ratified in 2016
6. In the UK, The Royal College of Anaesthetists recommends, in its Core standards for pain management services in the UK, the use of sucrose for painful procedures in infants. In conclusion, this is a very interesting and relevant protocol that addresses an important issue in neonatal pain management. It should contribute to the improvement of analgesic practices in this vulnerable population.References

The structure of the manuscript in title, abstract, problem statement (captured in the introduction and motivation), methodology, results and conclusions is appropriately clear and all sections are well written. The conclusions are well founded. The motivation in particular for the software tool is clear as is the potential impact of the tool.  The intended reader who might benefit most from the manuscript and tool - the experimental electrophysiologist generating ion channel screening data to predict potential safety issues - may find the methodology and underlying math daunting. Nonetheless there are principles described which need to be appreciated by those generating those data, especially when that data is further propagated in
in silico models of cardiac tissues. The authors have written and formatted the article very effectively to make the manuscript understandable and approachable. Given the availability of computational tools such as Python it is now also much more practical to perform these analyses and appropriately quantify the uncertainty. The practice of reporting 'best-fit' parameter values may have been the best which could practically be achieved previously. It may also have been a model sufficient for many questions but the developing need to use these data in computational models of tissues for safety purposes requires a more robust treatment of uncertainty. Simply carrying forward best-fit values and generating point estimates of effects on tissues and point estimates of margins between therapeutic drug concentrations and concentrations impacting cardiac tissues may not adequately serve drug development and regulatory assessment. In the practice of electrophysiology screening experiments some compromises are made in order to make the experiments both quick enough and inexpensive enough to meet the drug discovery process. This will often mean that a limited range of concentrations are tested and a minimum number of individual experimental repeats are made. When calculating 'best-fit' parameters some values are 'fixed' to make calculating the key parameter IC50 possible e.g. fixing minimum current inhibition to 0%, maximum inhibition to 100% and the Hill Slope to 1. The manuscript describes some of the potential issues which may result from such compromises. There are also hidden impacts of experimental design. As an example the experiment may call for following compound effect for as long as necessary to reach a steady state effect. As the kinetics of channel block are concentration dependent this means that steady state will occur more slowly at low concentrations. In addition to drug effect there is also often current 'run-down' or 'run-up' evident in these experiments. The 'run-down' effect is the more common. This means that at low concentrations of compound the observed effect may have a larger contribution of 'run-down' than at larger concentrations. This serves to somewhat flatten the Hill Slope and left shift the IC50 from 'truth'. Alternatively, fixed durations of observation may be applied at each concentration. As the norm is to try and minimize the overall duration of the recording this may mean that compound effect is under estimated at low concentrations leading to the Hill slope becoming steeper and the IC50 being slightly right shifted. Some electrophysiologists may choose to have uniform long compound application periods or use run-down correction techniques to minimize these experimental impacts on parameter estimates. The significant value of the current manuscript is that it allows the data from the experiments to be used in their most raw form without the compromises described. It leverages priors based on previous experimental information.  It gives the key information as a probability distribution rather than a single value. It also serves to illustrate the uncertainty and give the opportunity to generate more data for those compounds which show promise and where more certainty is desirable. There is one key outstanding element which the current manuscript cannot address. In this experimental context it is the assessment of the kinetics of block. When relating the effect of a compound to how it may impact a tissue when the underlying kinetics of the ion channel experiment and that of the ionic current in a tissue under the normal heart rates differ cannot be captured in an IC50 value or Hill slope even taking into account the uncertainty. This will likely require different experimental voltage-clamp paradigms and the estimation of at least one further parameter. That said that parameter estimate then becomes accessible to the types of calculation described here.  Overall this is a very well thought out piece of work, well written and with a potentially useful piece of software described.

 et al propose a new tool (PyHillFit) for fitting dose response curves from cardiac ion channels. This tool uses Bayesian inference methods to determine the distributions of the parameters. They investigate two alternative models, one that ignores inter-experimental variability and a second hierarchical model that characterises variability. Using a recently published dataset of inhibition of multiple ion channels they demonstrate the use of the tool and how experimental variability propagates through to the fitted dose response curves. They then extend these to simulations using a cardiac action potential model to show the distribution of model outputs. The benefits of a hierarchical Bayesian approach are clearly demonstrated. The paper describes the tool and its underlying model and assumptions well, but could benefit from further development of the arguments around the cardiac action potential distribution.Main Comments The most interesting part of the paper was propagating the uncertainty though the action potential simulations. The authors conclude that this measure is insufficient to distinguish compounds in terms of risk (Fig 15), but if the distributions were plotted so that they are not on top of each other it may indeed be possible to distinguish the compounds. For example, ""caterpillar plots"", boxplots, or violin plots (e.g. Fig 2 in
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096431) would better show the result. The authors also do not attempt to classify the compounds on the basis of their distribution (e.g. >50% of the distribution over a 10% prolongation of APD(90) to indicate risk of TdP) and so demonstrate how poor (or good) the distributions are as a predictive tool. The manuscript would be strengthened with this additional information.Minor Comments It is unclear why the PyHillFit package was developed as these models can be easily fit with existing MCMC software such as JAGS or Stan. Furthermore, using existing MCMC software allows other models to be fit (e.g. 4 parameter logistic models -- when the upper and lower asymptote are not rescaled to 100% and 0%), and the sampling may be more efficient (especially with Stan, which handles hierarchical models well). The benefits of PyHillFit over these other tools should be highlighted. The data are analysed with two models but the verbal description of the models is ambiguous. There are three models that could be run:
Parameters (IC50 and Hill) are common for all experiments (complete pooling, corresponding to the first model)Parameters are different for all experiments; each experiment has its own parameter estimated independently from the other experiments (no pooling; not used in this paper)Parameters are different for all experiments, but shared across experiments and thus mutually informative (partial pooling; the second model) It is clear from the equations that their second model is number 3 above, but the verbal description is that of number 2. Please clarify the verbal description. Other minor suggestions and corrections

The manuscript would be strengthened with this additional information.This is something we specifically tried to avoid, partly because it becomes a large exercise that detracts from the main software tool, and also not least because the risk of TdP is not well-defined or agreed upon for some of these compounds. Our point isn't that the distributions will help/hinder predictions per-se, rather you could easily be anywhere 'within' a distribution, so wherever they overlap there will necessarily be no way to reliably distinguish between compounds. If the 50% value happened to be a good classifier for these data, we would still not expect this to hold for new compounds, as the ordering could easily reverse when new data become available wherever the distributions overlap to this extent. Nevertheless, we annotated Figure 15 with risk classifications from the CredibleMeds database (a more credible data source than its name suggests!). As one might expect, only the clear shorteners and prolongers correspond well to ‘no known risk’ or ‘known TdP risk’; the majority of compounds have overlapping distributions of moderate APD prolongation, that cannot really be ranked reliably.> It is unclear why the PyHillFit package was developed as these models can be easily fit with existing MCMC software such as JAGS or Stan.

The benefits of PyHillFit over these other tools should be highlighted.PyHillFit is intended for the specific case of ion channel screening data. We do appreciate that this could have been coded in Stan, but we wanted to have more ‘control’ over what was happening below the surface, and in how the results were outputted and analysed, so we wrote the algorithms ourselves in Python. Perhaps as much of our ‘work’ here was in deriving the statistical model and appropriate prior distributions, as it was in writing the software itself.

Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.10736.r18560,Benejam,Bessy,NA,"1Down Medical Centre, Catalan Down Syndrome Foundation, Barcelona, Spain",approve,"Down syndrome (DS) is associated with a very high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Diagnosing dementia in individuals with DS can be difficult because of the challenges involved in assessing changes in people with pre-existing cognitive impairment and due to a lack of appropriate instruments. The authors study a very important topic, the search for an appropriate battery of tests suitable for the assessment of cognitive functions of individuals with a wide range of ages and intellectual disability (ID) severities, and for the early detection of cognitive decline associated to the development of AD. Startin and colleagues describe the LonDownS cognitive test battery for adults with Down syndrome (DS), and provide data on baseline cognitive and related informant assessments for two cohorts of participants (
cohort 1: adults aged 36 and over with or without clinical diagnosis of dementia;
cohort 2: adults aged 16-35 years). The authors found high completion rates across the tasks for individuals without dementia, with many showing low floor and ceiling effects. Results from individuals with dementia suggest lower completion rates (approximately half of the individuals with dementia were unable to undertake any task). To my point of view, the manuscript is well written, hypothesis and methods are adequately described, and it is overall well discussed. I have some suggestions to improve the manuscript format and some questions that the authors could clarify:
After reading the title of the manuscript, one expects to find some comparison in task performance between individuals with and without dementia, with the aim to find cognitive tasks able to discriminate well between both groups. I think the manuscript would benefit from the inclusion of a new table with the main outcome measures and results from informant questionnaires for both adults with and without dementia, with its statistical differences.The conclusions of the study are well written and described, but I suggest reviewing the “Conclusion” section of the Abstract because it does not explain what the current study found.As stated in the “Methods” section (Task administration),
the assessment was completed in one session where possible, approximately 3 hours in duration. Although this limitation is imposed by the study set up, this might represent a limitation worth mentioning. In my opinion, this duration might be too long for people with intellectual disability, a population that might get tired more easily and has usually difficulties with sustained attention. The validation study conducted by Sinai and colleagues, which found very similar scores for a number of tests (some of them also used by Startin and colleagues) when comparing dementia and no dementia groups of older people with DS, could help to reduce the length of the cognitive test battery.The authors recruited 51 adults aged 36 years and over, with a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Of these, 22 (43%) had a diagnosis of AD and 27 (more than 50%) had a diagnosis of dementia of unspecified type. This is a surprising high figure for a population with an ultra-high risk for AD. The manuscript does not describe who made the diagnosis of dementia or how it was made. It could also be interesting to include some information about the stage of the dementia. Which patients were unable to undertake the assessment? Was this related to a more advanced stage of dementia, or was this related to a more severe premorbid intellectual disability?The number of tables in the results section might be reduced. Some of them might be included if deemed important as supplementary material.

The ultimate goal of this study is to put the basis for a longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation of people with DS: The LonDownS Consortium, aimed at determining risk and protective factors for the development of dementia and factors relating to cognitive abilities in people with DS. The topic addressed by the authors is of great interest not only for people with DS. In fact, with the increase in life expectancy and the resulting aging of the general population, age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as neurocognitive impairment, are expected to increase. DS is considered a model of premature aging, and therefore the study of dementia in DS and the evaluation of favouring or protective factors, can bring benefits both for people with DS and for general population. 
 A comprehensive assessment The Authors performed a very comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, to assess a range of skills relevant to those brain areas most affected in DS, including general abilities, visuo-spatial and verbal memory, language skills, executive functions and motor coordination abilities.The effort to avoid floor and ceiling effects The Authors show not only the results and the related statistical analysis, but also the reasoning why they have chosen that specific test and the scientific background: in my opinion this issue is of great interest, because the neuropsychological evaluation of people with intellectual disability (ID) is a relatively young discipline, and there is a great effort worldwide aimed to identify a test battery specifically suitable for people with ID.  In fact, the main problem in the assessment of people with DS, and more generally of people with ID, is that most of the neuropsychological tests were conceived and designed for cognitive evaluation of people without ID. The consequence of this is that often they cannot be used in people with ID, because of the floor and ceiling effects. In both cases, they do not give indications for neuropsychological assessment and for longitudinal studies. The effort of the authors was to identify a set of tests that present minimum percentages of floor and ceiling effects, in order to make them suitable for the neuropsychological assessment of people with DS. According to the results this effort has been successful: in this study most of the persons with DS without dementia were able to perform the tests and the percentage of floor and ceiling effect was very low (except for CAMCOG – delayed incidental memory and KBIT-2 age-dependent IQ scores).Administration times Another important parameter is given by the administration times. The authors specify that the test administration, most often conducted in the person's home, lasted overall about three hours, including breaks necessary to rest and, wherever possible, physical measurements (height, weight, abdominal/ head/neck circumference, gait, blood pressure, and pulse). In my opinion it is a perfectly acceptable time for such a comprehensive assessment, also in the light of possible follow-up in order to detect early symptoms of cognitive decline.
 Some questions and suggestions Question 1: Have the Authors performed a correlation between cognitive scores and informant scores? Question 2: Have the Authors performed a correlation between age and cognitive/informant scores considering the whole group of persons with DS (16-35 years of age + aged 36 and over)   Question 3: Which informant questionnaire can be suggested by the Authors to be used in association with the tests listed in Box1 (Ideal outcome measures to use in future studies)? Suggestion: I think that the title of Table 11 is wrong and should be changed in “Correlations between informant scores and age across adults aged 16–35”I have read this submission.

 de novo assemblies of three new
P. vivax genomes and comparison with the reference Sal I genome and other Pv genomes. Compared with previous annotation of the reference genome, the new assembly of the PvP01 genome for an isolate from Papua Indonesia has reduced the total scaffolds from over 2500 in SalI to 226 (+14). Major improvements are in the subtelomeric regions, where a significantly increased number of pir genes have been discovered. This more in-depth study of the Pv genome and manual curation of genes provide a better resource for biological studies of the vivax parasite. Comments:
Abstract: The quality of the PvP01 assembly is improved greatly over Salvador-I, with fragmentation reduced to 226 scaffolds.  Perhaps “with fragmentation reduced to 226 unassigned scaffolds in addition to the 14 chromosomal scaffolds” will be more accurate?Does the “results” section begin at “Dataset validation”?Table 1 presented comparison of the genomes the three new sequences with that of Sal I. The PvC01 and PvT01 sequences contained more assigned scaffolds – are these located mostly in the telomeric regions?A more detailed comparison of the temperate strain PvC01 with the tropical strains would be more useful.  A big-picture type perspective on the C01 and T01 would be nice.Figure 1 illustrates the extension of the assembled sequences in the subtelomeric region of chrom12 as compared to that in SalI. Are the gap junctions verified by PCR? Also, the PvP01 also has quite some gaps – how are these assembled and verified?The network presentation of the Pir genes is interesting – A link to the alignment of the sequences or a phylogenetic tree-type of presentation (as supplements) would be very useful.

P. vivax reference sequence. The authors extensively sequenced a single-clone field isolate from Papua Indonesia using Illumina technology. Assembly of these sequence reads lead to a much less fragmented and better covered core genome sequence. Furthermore, the improved assembly and annotation resulted in a much more complete overview on the subtelomeric multi gene families in this and two other isolates from China and Thailand. Reference genomes are the foundation for all genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic studies. Therefore, this new reference genome sequence is very welcome and will undoubtedly fuel the exploration of the biology and pathogenesis of
P. vivax. While it is always difficult to access the quality of such assemblies based on description only it is conceivable that the 20x increase in coverage and the use of various post-assembly improvement tools have resulted in considerably better genome sequence. Furthermore, the manual curated gene models and functional classifications bring substantial added value to this work. Overall this study is well executed and the manuscript is well-written. I have only some minor suggestions for improvement:
It would be important to clarify in the manuscript why PvP01 has been chosen to be the new reference “strain”.Sequencing and annotation of multigene families is challenging. To fully exclude the possibility that the 5 new clusters of PIR proteins identified in this study are the result of incorrect sequence assembly it would be relevant to PCR amplify and sequence a representative member from each of these families.In the abstract the authors state that the new reference genome contains 226 scaffolds, while according to table 1 it appears to be 226+14. Please double-check.I do not find Table 2 particularly useful/informative. It is basically a tribute to a huge amount of work.It might not be formally required to include a subheading “Results” in Welcome Open Research data notes, but nonetheless it would be nice to know where the description of the results begins.It would bring added value to this article if Table 3 would be extended by description of all and not only the subtelomeric gene families (Table 2 in Tachibana
et al., 2012
1 could provide a nice example). Instead of the extensive footnotes an extra column could be included for alternative names.In Table 3 it is unclear if other genes includes only “Plasmodium exported protein of unknown function” or also other proteins. If there are indeed couple of hundred of these proteins encoded in the PvP01 genome and they localize to the subtelomeric regions as Figure 1 suggests, it would be perhaps relevant to discuss them as a gene family. It could even be worthwhile to perform a cluster analysis on this “gene family” similar to the one performed on PIR proteins.On Figure 2B it would be useful to indicate the correspondence between the cluster numbers of this study and the former classification (A-K). Similarly it would be informative to indicate the cluster numbers on Figure 2A.From Figure 2B it seems that cluster 5 PIR gene subfamily has expanded (substantially more numerous) in the Brazilian isolate. Something perhaps worthwhile mentioning/discussing.

There are other tools published that also specifically target exon copy number variants in targeted gene panels, such as CoNVaDING.P3. The TSCP contains 94 genes. An explanation is needed why only 10 of those genes are used as evaluation set.P4. ‘DECoN relies on a high level of correlation between samples’. It is unclear if this correlation should already be present in the samples analyzed (by analyzing only samples belonging to the same pool) or if DECoN performs a correlation calculation and based on that calculation selects a subset of samples for further calculations. Can DECoN also analyze samples that are not sequenced in the same pool?P4. Is the correlation score in the report used as a quality metric, and if yes, how? And how were the correlation scores for the samples analyzed?P4. What are the suggested thresholds to flag samples /exons which may have suboptimal performance? Were such thresholds used in the evaluation set? Is the Bayes factor used as part of the quality metric? And if yes,
P6. how many samples and exons were flagged? In my opinion this is a critical step in analysis. For clinical detection it is just as important to know which exons can’t be reliably analyzed in the data as to know which can. This creates the difference between a false negative result and a failed sample/failed exon analysis. What was the flag status of the exon 8-11 FP duplication.P6. Why were simulated samples entirely comprised of samples with a exon CNVs excluded from specificity calculations. There can still be a false positive result in other (two copy) exons.P6. Please state explicitly the specificity of the 8 non-BRCA genes in the evaluation set, even though this is 100%.P6. It would also be interesting to know the specificity and sensitivity for the other 84 genes in the TSCP.P6. How is the quality of the evaluated exons compared to the other exons in the TSCP? Can the sensitivity and specificity and exons passing quality control be extrapolated to genes outside the evaluation panel?P6 and table 2.  Instead of the number of reads per sample I would mention the average coverage / read depth of the evaluated exons. This is a more informative value, since it is independent of panel size.P7, figure 2:  What is the flag status of exon 20 in the duplication set? In other words, why does this exon perform worse than the others, especially since the sensitivity for deletions is so highP7, figure 2:  Can dots for specificity be added to the graph?P8.

Somewhere in the paper the authors should describe the approximate proportion of differentiated LUHMES neurons that express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). This proportion has been reported to vary greatly between laboratories, and it would be helpful if this outcome is described briefly in the text (and possibly with a photo).There is no description of what the different changes in phenotype the different genetic manipulations cause.

C. elegans genome ce10 and human hg19 and we proceeded with this one.Genomes upload: One can select the desired genome on the proposed list but the action of « install selected » stops half way after indicating « installing packages: BSgenome.Scerevisiae.U ». The blue progression line stops but no error message appears, leaving no option to correct any possibility of upload. There is no indication of genome format file needed to upload, whether it would be FASTA, indexed genome or anything else.Data upload:  Data (bam, wig, bigwig) can be easily uploaded to Seqplots that automatically converts any format in bigwig to allow better handling. Data upload time is directly dependent on your data size. After upload, the file is directly converted to bigwig.New Plot Set: To generate a profile plot or heatmap, one has to chose two files: the file containing the signal intensity (wig, sam …) and the file containing the selected annotations of interest such as genes, protein coding genes, promoters. This second file can be at the bed, gtf or gff format. Several files can be processed in a single analysis; the visualization tool uses results to plot individual or combined profiles as selected by the user.Options to select: - Bin size of the signal file has to be known in advance and it is important to adjust this parameter properly, ideally identical to the original data input bin size. If using a bin size below the actual data, it will introduce wholes in the plot. Conversely, using a larger bin size will smooth the data, which can be useful for clarity of the results but can also result in a loss of resolution. This point could be clarified in the documentation. We also note that the link to explanation is essentially inactive. - The ‘point view’, ‘end point’ or ‘midpoint’ options are easy to understand as start, middle and end of the features. The ‘anchored features’ option is a bit less obviously accessible, and should be explained more clearly.Profiles: Profiles are easily generated and modified using indicated options, and overall functions well. That the user could directly change the labels below the plots could be a possible improvement.Heatmaps: This option also allows clustering of the data with a nice graphical interface, including nice color options. When the process is complete, this tool is very useful to identify classes of genes/features and to explore the data. However, we note that calculation time for heatmap generation can be limiting and varies quite a lot from one time to the other. Unfortunately, no error message appears to explain if something went wrong on the interface while generating the heatmap. Sometimes the message is blocked in “exporting results” but these are never exported.General considerations and conclusion: Seqplots can be used quite easily by non bio-informaticians with minimum training. We believe that this software fulfills many of the analysis options that biologists are looking for when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data sets, including ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. It has therefore a great potential of usage by the community of scientists interested in genomic science. We also found that improvements remain possible and suggest debugging more specifically the following points.
The genome upload issue has to be fixed.Documentation should be developed for the sections ‘genome upload’,There is no possibility to run two jobs in parallel. Seqplots could allow the opening of two windows or more.Error messages have to be clearer and help the user to make a decision on what should be done.Heatmap generation jobs are often aborted during calculations.

I was able to get the package up and running, and generate plots from my own data very quickly after installation through the GUI, which was intuitively navigable. It is clear that a lot of work has gone into providing an impressive array of options to the user. The manuscript itself gives an adequate, if brief, description of the purpose and typical output of the resource. It does not attempt to serve as user manual or tutorial. A tutorial is provided as a separate, regularly updated document. The tutorial is very detailed, although a few relative links were broken. My one suggestion would be to provide easy access to the example data through the tutorial - I couldn't find it without digging into the package source. Adding an example line of `run(root='/path/to/ex/data')` in the tutorial would be a simple way to do this.   In the future, it may be worth considering developing a scriptable back-end to the package, so that users who are comfortable with R can automate their pipelines. Overall, for those who want a graphical interface to make these plots this is a very useful resource.  ---- Note: Malcolm Perry tested the software and wrote most of the above comments.We have read this submission.

To start with my major point, I regret to say that I can not recommend SeqPlots in its current form. The main issue I have is with installation. This is a common hurdle with bioinformatics software, however, it is an important factor for a software tool. I don't gain any satisfaction from pointing this out, as the author has clearly spent a lot of effort on creating installers for all three major operating systems. However, I was not able to install SeqPlots in any form. I do have to admit here that I am not experienced in R. However, I do use other R modules without problems and SeqPlots is positioned as a tool for those with little computational training. I tried the following:
Linux AppImage (Ubuntu 14.04)Linux zipped application (Ubuntu 14.04)Linux R installation (two different computers running Gentoo Linux)Windows MSI package (Windows 7)Windows zipped application (Windows 7)
 These all failed in different ways:
& 2. I get a “Loading, please wait” prompt, with “Seqplots is running: false” on the command line.          3. After the run() command I get a greyed out, non-responsive webpage.          4. “Installation has failed” (this was after I had to upgrade .NET to be able to run the installer).          5. There were so many files (700MB in 10,000+ files) that extracting/copying the application took too much time and broke it off. I recommend that the authors simplify installation options and then make sure that these really work. For instance, for Windows, there are three different ways to install the package. It is a lot of work to test and support all these releases. In my case not one out of five options worked. Personally, I can highly recommend bioconda, however, other working options would also be fine. Given that I could not use the application I have not been able to asses practical use of SeqPlots with my own data. With that out of the way, I have to say that the application (as far as I could judge from the demo and the manuscript) seems to be a useful and interesting tool. Documentation is excellent at first glance, although I haven't practically used it. The software is available at Github and archived via Zenodo, perfect. One thing that I wondered is how the authors address reproducibility issues. Are the parameters that were used for an analysis saved somewhere? As it is easy to generate many different plots, it would be good to have a way to keep track of this. Some other minor remarks and points:
The authors mention other tools that are “Slow and laborious” and “difficult to use by investigators with little computational training”. I would much prefer that the authors phrase this more positively. This publication will not be screened for novelty, so no reason to downplay other excellent, widely used tools. What are the key properties that are unique to SeqPlots?“Such plots are usually generated using online or command line tools such as Galaxy/Cistrome, ngs.plot, and deeptools, or using custom scripts combined with plotting software such as Gnuplot.” A bit pedantic, but I'm not sure anyone uses gnuplot in the various genomics fields. There are other methods that deserve mention, ggplot and R come to mind, and various other plotting tools that have more or less the same functionality.I am not a native English speaker, but I am unsure if “wide data exploration” is an existing concept.“Common examples are the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation for the analysis of chromatin modifications or factor binding, enzymatic digestions for chromatin structure assays, and RNA sequencing to assess gene expression changes after biological perturbations.” Here, “factor binding” should probably be “transcription factor binding”?Are gzipped files accepted as input (for instance for bed and bigbed)?The distinction between the “Methods” and the “Implementation” section is a bit fuzzy to me.It would be good to add a LICENSE/COPYING file to the repository with the software license.Don't use the rainbow/jet palette as the default color scheme, it has too many shortcomings.

They observed a pro-inflammatory response but only modest antiviral effects. Although the findings are interesting there are several limitations regarding the experimental design.
The choice of IL-27 dosing as well as the treatment duration is unclear; rationales need to be given here.The immunofluorescent staining in Figure 1 needs a DAPI signal to indicate HCV negative cells.There are discrepancies between the text and the Figure. Page 4: “… however, the effect is overall limited compared to the IFNγ positive control (Figure 1B) and was not significantly different when measured at a later time point (day 13).” There is no IFNγ mentioned in Figure 1.The HBV data given in Figure 1D are insufficient to draw any conclusions on IL-27 treatment. These data are of minor quality and need to be complemented (HBeAg, HBV DNA) or discarded.The number of replicates and repetitions within diverse experiments is not clear, especially for the gene array. Furthermore, the validation was performed with a single gene (CXCL-10) at a diverse time point.The links in the legend of Figure 2 seemed to be wrong. No IL-15 treatment is mentioned there.Drawing conclusions on antiviral responses of hepatocytes, while using Huh7 hepatoma cell line, is false. Here only suggestions can be made.

The results demonstrated a pro inflammatory rather than antiviral effect of IL-27.  
The in vitro culture systems are excellent in evaluating direct antiviral effects of biologics and drugs. However, it does not allow us to quantitate the indirect effects (on T cells and other immune cells). Hence, based on these results, we cannot assume IL-27 has no antiviral effect mediated via immune cell potentiation, as it is expected to.Please explain the rationale for selecting 100ng dose for IL-27. It would have been preferable to perform a dose ranging studies to better inform of antiviral effect.Why was IFN-gamma used as positive control? Why not, IFN-alpha? There are more validated data about IFN-alpha mediated suppression of HCV in vitro than IFN-gamma.IL-27 receptor expression on target cells was not evaluated in the study. This could be an important factor in determining what cell types respond to IL-27. Ideally, the measuring the density of the receptor on the cells would be beneficial to rule out cell line specific factors for discrepancy in the results.The results shown here for HCV are quite different from previous published reports, some of which have shown significant effect on HCV replication. This study has evaluated HCV replication by PCR and IF and demonstrates no effect on HCV replication. The reasons for such discrepancy are not clear. Cell lines could have acquired or lost characteristics over time and could behave differently. Do we know the genotype of this cell line? Is it IL28B CC or TT?Gene expression results shown in Figure 2 shows overlapping patterns with IL-15 induced gene expression in CD8 and NK cells. I am not sure what this means since gene expression in different cell types are likely to be controlled by cell specific transcriptional patterns and not comparable to effects of different cytokine on completely different cell types. This would benefit form addition of a description that will explain the results better.Also, what was the rationale to choose 72 hours post treatment for gene expression analysis? Earlier studies have shown immediate induction of ISGs with Interferons and other antiviral cytokines.Cell type specific expression of ISGs have been associated with favorable responses to interferon-alpha in patients. For example, higher expression of ISGs in hepatocyte is associated with a poor response to IFN-alpha, while a higher expression of ISGs in monocytes is associated with SVR. Hence, a lack of ISG expression in this hepatocyte cell line may be associated with an overall favorable host ISG response. Effects of IL-27 on other cell types may provide clues on the net effect of this cytokine on host innate response to HCV.

The experiments were well designed and performed. In addition, the results were described almost properly. In this meaning, the manuscript is sound and suitable for the indexing. However, as I mentioned below, this manuscript has still some points to be clearly explained.
Comparison of the genome sequences of human bocaviruses between from Vietnam and the others should be much more discussed.To date, all of the HBoV genotypes contain the episomal structure. Then, it would be better to analyze it in the paper.The genome of HBoV is organized in three ORFs: ORF1 encoding NS1 protein; ORF2 encoding NP1 protein; ORF3 encoding VP1 and VP2 proteins. So it was suggested that the Phylogenetic trees of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the HBoV genes should be constructed.

The authors show that they have detected 4 bocaviruses in enterovirus positive samples, as identified by RT-PCR, which demonstrates the strength of agnostic deep sequencing.

In the other datasets from the remaining two swabs only partial genomic sequences of HBoV, each with 2870bp in length and a mean coverage of 15.4 and 448.7, were recovered. Subsequent sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis using MUSCLE and Neighbor-joining available in Geneious (Biomatters), respectively (Figure 1) revealed that all 3 Vietnamese HBoV recovered from the throat swabs belonged to HBoV-1 and had >98% of sequence similarity at nucleotide level with other HBoV-1. The other recovered from rectal swab belonged to HBoV-2 and had a close relatedness with a Thai strain CU54TH (GU048663) with a sequence similarity of 97.3% (Figure 1).” Additionally, we have also discussed the detection of HBoV-1 and HBoV-2 in throat- and rectal swab, respectively in the discussion section.In the abstract the authors mention that “The sequences may aid future study aiming at understanding the evolution of the pathogen”.

The lines chosen for this study were selected as they are homozygous lethal or subviable at weaning but viable at E14.5. The authors employ High Resolution Episcopic Microscopy to capture 3D images of the embryos, providing exquisitely detailed documentation of embryo morphologies. They exploit this rich dataset with a systematic and in depth annotation of morphological defects which they record using appropriate levels of MP terms. The result is a survey of impressive scope in terms of annotation depth and volume of data, and a superb effort of data organisation and analysis so the great complexity of the dataset can be distilled to overall observations and discussion points. This organisation effort yielded a really useful framework for systematic analysis of the morphology of mouse mutant of that stage. The authors conclude that a salient point of the work is the great variability of penetrance of the morphological phenotypes they find among these mutant embryos of the same isogenic genetic background. Although the variable expressivity of phenotype between different individuals of a same mutant line isn’t a new concept, the unexpected result of the study is the extend to which phenotypes (even when grouped in broad categories such as “organ affected”) vary in penetrance, albeit that these mutants share the broadest of phenotype which is lethality. However, the authors restrict their analysis to the variability amongst mutants and they mention in the discussion an on-going systematic analysis of WT embryos, which will provide key information to put in context the observations collated in this article. Whereas the article is an excellent effort of presenting a complex dataset with clarity and granularity and documenting variability of morphology amongst samples, the data presented do not allow the reader to identify the reason(s) of this variability in the absence of key information. Three major points should be addressed:
The authors made the unusual choice of not presenting baseline data on the morphology of wild-type mutants (littermates) produced in the study. Such data, surveying significant groups of control embryos, would be essential to establish the link between mutations and described phenotypes. In the absence of this data, any reference to a causal link between phenotypes and mutation should be removed from the article.Both targeted traps (tm1a) and null (tm1b and CRISPR induced deletions) alleles are employed in the study. Both the presence of a selection cassette and the unpredictability of efficiency of trapping cassette(s) could form the basis of at least some of the variability shown in this study. An evaluation of variability (particularly using slim terms) within each of these 2 groups of alleles would help to address this point.Subviable lines show by definition a partially penetrant phenotype and contribute to a quarter of the mutant studied. An evaluation of variability (particularly using slim terms) within lethal and subviable as separate alleles groups would discriminate whether variability of morphology is particularly occurring among subviable lines.   Minor points:
Methods should detail information that permit the appraisal of materials used in the study, detailing the genetic background of stem cells and animals employed for germline transmission, and further breeding, including whether homozygotes were used to produce embryos to analyse subviable lines.Methods should outline the steps taken to limit manual annotation variability (i.e. secondary calling or benchmarking between annotators).All titles and text should precisely detail when lethal or both lethal and subviable mutations are presented.

In the absence of this data, any reference to a causal link between phenotypes and mutation should be removed from the article. We have included the wild type phenotype data in the revised version of the manuscript (see the detailed response to Rosenthal/Murray for more details).Both targeted traps (tm1a) and null (tm1b and CRISPR induced deletions) alleles are employed in the study. Both the presence of a selection cassette and the unpredictability of efficiency of trapping cassette(s) could form the basis of at least some of the variability shown in this study. An evaluation of variability (particularly using slim terms) within each of these 2 groups of alleles would help to address this point. The revised manuscript now includes separate analysis of phenotypes for the 22 tm1a alleles compared with 20 complete nulls (19 tm1b and 1 CRISPR). With either allele, blood vessel, heart and brain morphology remain amongst the most commonly observed abnormalities. However, with such relatively small numbers, we feel there is little more that can usefully be concluded from comparison of individual phenotype prevalence, since this will be heavily influenced by the distinct gene identities within each allele group. In contrast, there is a clear difference in phenotype penetrance between the two groups: phenotypes are clearly more penetrant from tm1b alleles (see new Figure 8A and 8B). We presume that this reflects the fact that whilst mutations based on tm1a alleles have the potential to be hypomorphic, those converted from tm1a to tm1b contain an exon deletion (and no longer carry the neo selection cassette).Subviable lines show by definition a partially penetrant phenotype and contribute to a quarter of the mutant studied. An evaluation of variability (particularly using slim terms) within lethal and subviable as separate alleles groups would discriminate whether variability of morphology is particularly occurring among subviable lines. We presume that the reviewer is wondering whether the difference between lethal and subviable lines is a result of differing degrees of penetrance of phenotypes that result in embryo death. Answering this point is not as simple as it might appear as it touches on a much more profound issue raised by studies such as ours. Whilst we are able to distinguish a remarkable number of different structural abnormalities by virtue of the resolution HREM imaging affords, it may not be at all clear which of these results in embryo lethality. Many profound abnormalities may be compatible with life and lethality may also result from structurally subtle changes. Without knowing which of the scored phenotypes are likely to cause lethality, it will be difficult if not impossible to establish of differences in their penetrance distinguish subviable from lethal lines. Add to this the additional difficulty that dams have a propensity to eat newborns that are not thriving well and there is a further complication in interpreting the data. We have nevertheless reexamined the phenotype data in order to compare the results separately for lethal and subviable lines (new Supplementary Figure 4). From this it is clear that there is insufficient data from subviable lines to draw unequivocal conclusions. Overall, the approximate prevalence of particular phenotype terms (using the intermediate slim) appears broadly similar to that of lethals, but for most of these, the numbers of affected lines are too few to make useful estimates of penetrance.Minor points: 1. Full details of genetic background and mutant allele are now provided for each line (revised Table 1). 2. All phenotyping was performed according to a standardised and sequential procedure, as mentioned in Material and methods. The data from each embryo was independently reviewed by a second anatomist and any discrepancies resolved by joint agreement. 3.

The level of granularity in the scoring of the phenotypes is a major strength of the paper, and reflects the deep and unique expertise of the team. This has facilitated the discovery of widespread variable penetrance in mutant embryos at a level of detail not previously described. Furthermore, the effort to organize the MP into a series of “slims” is quite useful for organizing the calls into easier to analyze groups, and such work will likely benefit other groups such as the IMPC.  The manuscript is clearly written and, importantly, goes to great lengths to ensure full access to all data. In addition to minor issues detailed below, there are two major gaps, however, that must be addressed.
There is no description of the number of control embryos screened or the incidental rate of hits for each phenotype in the DMDD list. Given the focus of the paper on the variability of phenotype penetrance and the number of phenotypes with an “n=1”, it is impossible to draw conclusions without this information. While the authors allude to a manuscript in preparation, it is actually essential data for this paper.Similarly, there is no description of how the authors account for global developmental delay in mutants, which can lead to many “phenotypes” that are merely the result of slowed/retarded development or variability in developmental timing between litters. For example, at E14.5, one would expect a high rate of cleft palate in mutants that have some level of overall delay, or in entire delayed litters, as the palate is elevating and fusing at that time point. This raises the following questions: are controls from each litter collected? How is uniform staging assured? Are “delayed” embryos compared to a stage-matched control? Again, the authors allude to another manuscript, but some of this information needs to be included here to assure the MP calls do not have trivial explanations.   Minor points:
 While the brief description of the animal resource and use of website citation is acceptable, given the main finding of variable penetrance, the authors should make a point of describing the isogenic genetic background and the nature of the alleles (tm1a or tm1b) in the methods and results.It’s not entirely clear if this was a set of 42 genes that were lethal/subviable at wean, or if this was a select set of lethal genes that were viable/subviable (present) at E14.5. Given the comments in the discussion about lines lethal at E9.5 or earlier, I assume the latter. This should be spelled out.Mouse gene symbols should be italicized.Apart from Table 1, the tables are too large and make reading a PDF a somewhat painful process. These might not be easily compressed, so most of the information should be moved to a supplemental file.

Given the focus of the paper on the variability of phenotype penetrance and the number of phenotypes with an “n=1”, it is impossible to draw conclusions without this information. While the authors allude to a manuscript in preparation, it is actually essential data for this paper.  The revised manuscript now includes the complete phenotype data obtained for 114 wild type embryos. This comprises 56 phenotype calls, affecting 32 embryos, originating from 28 lines (revised Tables 1, 2B and Supplementary Table 5). 21 of the 56 phenotype calls (38%) are accounted for by only 6 embryos, (indicating the skewing effect of a small number of abnormal embryos), most affected embryos showing only a single phenotype. This is in marked contrast to the finding of many different phenotypes in individual mutant embryos. The phenotypes of wild types vary in character, ranging from apparently minor differences (e.g. in blood vessel morphology) to a few major abnormalities (e.g. absent kidney). Each one is rare amongst the population of wild type embryos analysed and affects only a single wild type embryo within the line. Only 10 phenotypes (15 phenotype calls) overlap between mutant embryos and their wild type siblings and these affect only 10 of the 41 lines for which wild type embryos have been assessed (Table 3). As we discuss in the revised Results and Discussion sections, these data raise 3 related questions: Why are phenotypes detected in genetically wild type embryos? Are there “background” phenotypes associated with the C57BL/6N line that contribute to the mutant phenotypes scored? Is there any evidence for “background” phenotypes associated with an individual knockout line? We think there are several possible explanations for finding phenotypes amongst wild type embryos. One possibility is that the mouse strain that has been used for engineering knockout lines carries a “background load” of abnormalities, previously unappreciated. Ours is the first systematic study on sufficiently large scale and employing sufficiently high resolution imaging to detect such abnormalities. Amongst the phenotypes identified, none shows significant prevalence that might be expected if it was a strain-specific abnormality. Another possible explanation is that abnormalities arise as a consequence of de novo mutation and the frequency we detect reflects the high sensitivity that results from HREM imaging. Lastly, at least with the less apparently severe abnormalities, it is possible that some of these in fact represent outliers on spectrum of normal morphological variation and should not be considered genuine abnormalities. This highlights an important issue confronting phenotyping studies: the dearth of large-scale and systematic studies examining normal embryo morphology that can set a reliable benchmark for distinguishing abnormalities from normal variation. In this light, phenotype data may need revision as cumulative experience improves our ability to distinguish abnormalities from variation amongst wild types. Whatever the explanation, it is clear that neither the frequency, prevalence nor nature of the phenotypes identified in wild type embryos impact significantly on the assignation of phenotypes amongst the homozygous mutant embryos.Similarly, there is no description of how the authors account for global developmental delay in mutants, which can lead to many “phenotypes” that are merely the result of slowed/retarded development or variability in developmental timing between litters. For example, at E14.5, one would expect a high rate of cleft palate in mutants that have some level of overall delay, or in entire delayed litters, as the palate is elevating and fusing at that time point. This raises the following questions: are controls from each litter collected? How is uniform staging assured? Are “delayed” embryos compared to a stage-matched control? Again, the authors allude to another manuscript, but some of this information needs to be included here to assure the MP calls do not have trivial explanations. We believe it is important to distinguish between the effect of precise developmental stage of phenotyping and the issue of developmental retardation or delay. We can now reference the published study we mentioned that addresses these very questions (Geyer et al. 2017, J. Anat. in press). We do indeed collect wild type controls from each litter but our experience has demonstrated that precise stage matching of mutants with controls is essential to underpin accurate phenotyping. To facilitate this, we have analysed a large number of wild type embryos from the same genetic background as the that used for engineering of mutant lines. We have developed a system that can reliably distinguish five sub-stages within the span of Theiler stages 21 to 22 that are collected during E14.5, enabling us to compare each mutant embryo against precise, developmental stage-matched controls. Careful study and comparison of these has identified those changes (such as fusion of palatal shelves) which occur during the window of development that we observe. By combining qualitative comparisons with quantitative morphometry and statistical analysis, we are able to distinguish what can be considered genuine abnormalities from features that show either rapid developmental change or significant variability in the developmental timing of their appearance. A more precise staging system also allows us to phenotype homozygous mutant embryos accurately, even though they frequently show some developmental delay, since we are able to compare them to controls at the equivalent stage of development. It also allows us to score instances of heterochrony where this affects individual (or a limited subset of) organs or tissues. By analysing a large number of wild type embryos harvested at E14.5, we have identified the spread and distribution of individual developmental sub stages that might be expected, and on this basis have a robust, statistical definition for global developmental retardation. Our studies do not allow us to identify why such retardation is relatively common amongst mutant embryos, but do offer some interesting pointers that we have commented upon. Retardation is, for example, much more common in mutant embryos showing cardiovascular defects (Geyer et al. 2017, J. Anat. in press). Furthermore, a surprisingly large proportion of mutants show abnormalities in their placental structure, and this may perhaps impact on their overall growth and development (unpublished data).Minor points 1. The genetic background and details of each allele are now included in revised Table 1. 39 of the 42 lines analysed are on an identical background (C57BL/6N;C57BL/6NTac). 22 lines contain the tm1a allele, 19 contain tm1b and 1 line was produced using CRISPR. 2. The “Embryos” section of Materials and Methods details how the 42 lines were designated as lethal or subviable at wean (P14). 3. Mouse gene symbols have been italicised. 4. It was not possible for the larger tables to be moved to supplementary files; this is an unfortunate limitation of the online presentation method. Wellcome Open Research requested that the tables were included as figures rather than supplementary data and we agree that it is helpful for the reader to see the nature of the data. We had hoped that the individual files could also be downloaded in their spreadsheet format to allow full interrogation but the interface does not currently allow this. We have requested this change but in the meantime large tables are now also included in supplemental spreadsheet files to allow the reader to search and filter the data as required.",6,3,2017,2017-3-6,PMC5159622,Research Article,27996060,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.9899.2,Highly variable penetrance of abnormal phenotypes in embryonic lethal knockout mice.,2016-11-15,research-article; journal article;

et al. report even the consequences of specific mutations are significantly less predictable than we might expect. The Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders (DMDD) programme aims to analyse 240 embryonic lethal mouse knockout lines over a five-year period to study genes essential for mouse embryonic development and survival. This paper provides the first report on results gathered thus far. Wilson et al performed a detailed assessment of morphological abnormalities at stage E14.5 in 220 embryos from 42 novel mouse gene knockout lines. High Resolution Episcopic Microscopy was used to detect abnormalities at a scale from whole organs and tissues down to individual nerves and blood vessels. They report multiple abnormalities in virtually all of the embryos studied. They generated a wealth of information; in excess of 1.6 million images including more than 700,000 transverse sections to detail the incidence of structural abnormalities in 209 of the 220 embryos analysed. Eleven of the embryos from nine different lines were apparently normal. To provide systematic phenotypic data Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology terms were used to classify abnormalities with high and intermediate levels. This allowed the authors to calculate a penetrance score for the terms in each of the mutant lines and to assign these to a quartile percentage group. Only 3 phenotypes were 100% penetrant and over half of the abnormalities had a penetrance score under 25%.     Approximately one third of mouse gene knockouts are lethal and 60% of lethal lines entering the DMDD programme fail to provide homozygous mutant offspring by E14.5 with half of those being lethal prior to E9.5. Thus, as the authors point out, the data presented are from a subset of lethal lines. However, the most striking aspect of this study is the variability in penetrance of virtually all of the phenotypes analysed. Recent studies sequencing human exome DNA has identified a high frequency of loss of function mutations. A study by Lek et al 2016
1 examined more than 60,000 human exomes and reported predicted homozygous loss of function genotypes in 1775 genes. On average there are 35 homozygous gene deletions in each human. Thus the comment by Wilson et al in the present paper is particularly pertinent; relating these findings to human developmental disease will require further sophisticated analysis. It would appear that homozygous loss of function mutations are more common than previously realised and, furthermore, the consequences of loss of function mutations are much more variable than previously realised. It will not be trivial to unmask the causes of this variability. We are only just beginning to scratch the surface of understanding the consequences of loss of function mutations in both mice and humans. I have only one minor suggestion.

The use of crosslinking MS is a powerful tool for elucidating the solution state dynamics of proteins in their near-native environments. The study features the use of non-deuterated and deuterated crosslinking reagents which are used as molecular reporters of the accessibility distribution of crosslinked residues specific to the C3 and C3b structures. The data is of high quality and presented in an appealing and clear format. The structural transition of C3 to C3b is accompanied by large conformational changes (as seen with the crystal structures of C3 and C3b), and is a suitable and relatable model system to other researchers in structural biology who may deal with systems that exhibit similar dynamics. The authors describe a limitation with chemical crosslinking MS: “Cross-linking is renowned for low reproducibility”, which appears a bit of an unclear statement. While labelled residue pairs reported from experimental replicas may not be 100% identical, the strategy should be representative of the state-specific labelling status of the protein, and not dramatically influenced by downstream or other processing procedures. Although the geometry and accessibility of crosslinked residue pairs are important to consider when evaluating crosslinks, the authors have highlighted a limitation with projection of crosslinks onto crystal structures. The nature of models generated from X-ray crystallography represent a stable solid-state conformation which is often a poor indicator of the solution-state dynamics. Side chain orientations of crystallised proteins may be influenced depending on crystal packing and model bias introduced during refinement of the structure. A quick check of the C3 and C3b crystal structures (PDB ID 2A73 and 2I07) reveal them to be at 3.3 and 4.0 Å resolution, and as such it may be a stretch to use a theoretical crosslinking limit of 27.4 Å to demonstrate subtle conformational changes with a model derived from low resolution X-ray crystallography. It may be more reliable to use a lower-resolution distance limit such as 30 Å and measure from backbone atoms (which are more reliably fitted from electron density data). If considering the solvent accessibility and flexibility of specific residues, it may be appropriate to complement such data with b-factors deposited with the crystal structures, or RMSF values derived from molecular dynamic simulations. In the Supplementary Figure S2, the crosslinked residue pairs K1346-K1359 in panel (a) have been described as becoming “less favourable for cross-linking” in the C3b model. Could the authors describe what they mean by “less favourable”, and perhaps annotate the figure with the measured Euclidean distances for these examples? Without accompanying flexibility data, it is difficult to support and substantiate the probability of a crosslink being formed between rotamers of side chains found in the crystal structure. In panel (b) of the figure, it is difficult to see how the authors have deduced that the “flexibility of cross-linked residues reduce”.Minor points of revision:Figures 3 and 4 are referred to before Figure 2.The legend of Figure 5.

The method was previously used to investigate properties of two distinct conformations of complement C3(H2O) protein which arise due to proteolytic cleavage. Here the protocol and data analysis strategies are described in greater detail than in earlier publications, which is of benefit to researchers considering to implement the quantitative aspect in their own cross-linking/MS investigations. An important part of this workflow is the ‘label-swap’ aspect, whereby the deuterated cross-linker is used first on one sample, and then on the other. Combining this data then negates any effect of the cross-linker label, since it has been used with both samples. The approach appears to be robust, and it is certainly demonstrated on a very suitable protein.Conclusions and Data: A slight disadvantage of this approach (which also applies to all other quantitative workflows) is that some cross-links of low abundance will not be identified. The non-crosslinked peptides from the digests of C3 and C3b will have the same m/z value, whilst the cross-linked peptides will have a different m/z because of the isotopic XL-reagent. Therefore, the relative signal intensity for the XL peptides in the mixed sample is 50% compared to non-mixed. Whilst this doesn’t affect the study in question which only considers the quantifiable cross-linked peptides, it would be useful to mention this limitation and to point out that if the unmixed samples are initially analysed more cross-links could be identified, which may help in further studies. If a given lab uses the D0-D4 x-linker as standard then this point is moot. But that point should be mentioned here. It would also be interesting to know how the researchers verified that they are mixing a 1:1 ratio of digested peptides from the different samples. On the gel, there is less monomeric protein in the C3b sample, because more multimers are formed. Is this taken into consideration? Is it possible to show if the ‘deuteration’ of the cross-linker affects the extent of cross-linking? If the C3-light and C3-heavy are analysed together it could be seen if more cross-links are found with one than with the other. This would support the need for label swaps. For the SCX ‘enrichment’ step… it would be interesting to know whether the peptides are enriched with respect to non-cross-linked, or just separated from each other. A comparison of PSMs of linear peptides and cross-linked peptides would be beneficial. A technical point is that the figures are not in the correct order. Figure 2 is not mentioned until after Figure 4 in the text. The authors should mention HDX-MS and other MS based foot-printing approaches (for example FPOP) as a competing/ complementary technologies. The use of HDX-MS along with chemical crosslinking could be highly informative here. The time scale effects mentioned in conclusion can be better explored with the use of robotics and/ or photo-induced labelling and this may be a good direction for further study. In general the article requires significant editing; there are many instances where definite articles are missing, words are not pluralised, and words are not spelt correctly. We also think that the article suffers a little from too much opinion regarding the technology for example: Page 1 second paragraph, Cross-linking is renowned for low reproducibility.

This article complements earlier reports from the group that focused on the application of the method to more extended biological problems. In the present work, the emphasis is on method design and how QCLMS data can give insight into conformational changes within proteins. QCLMS is an emerging technique in structural proteomics / structural mass spectrometry, and there have been only few applications so far. Therefore, only limited knowledge exists concerning how data emerging from such experiments should be interpreted. As Chen
et al,. rightly point out, abundance changes of cross-linked peptides can be caused by different types of changes in the protein structure besides a major conformational rearrangement, and the C3 system actually provides several different examples that point to relatively small changes in the immediate vicinity of cross-linked residues (steric clashes, changes in solvent accessibility etc.). Therefore, the results presented here add valuable insight into what QCLMS can tell us (or not tell us) about protein structures, and these results can be extended to other studies. In addition, the article provides a more detailed description of the methods employed by the Rappsilber group in a concise format, including experimental design (label-swap experiment) and data analysis strategy. All results are properly documented and the raw mass spectrometry data have been deposited in the PRIDE repository. I have one comment regarding a somewhat vague statement in the introduction: ""Cross-linking is renowned for low reproducibility."" This may be an unconcious feeling that some of us working in this area have. Is there any reference that the authors can cite that supports this statement? Indeed, in view of the results presented in this work, the reproducibility of QCLMS, or CLMS in general, does not appear to be such a major concern, but rather seems to be affected by parameters not directly connected to the cross-linking procedure, such as undersampling in the mass spectrometer. Two minor technical points:
Figures 3 and 4 are referred to ahead of Figure 2, so the authors should consider renumbering the figures.Starting on page 7, the authors refer to individual domains of the C3 protein. It would be helpful to add a respective illustration in one of the figures for reference.

In line with my first comment, the literature search should be broadened in order to avoid missing relevant publications. More importantly, will there be a quality check of entries provided by users? If so, the authors should describe how this is done.I believe, the database would be more helpful, if the epitopes were listed as a single entry with all relevant references linked to it. Some epitopes have been described in multiple publications (e.g. the A*02-restricted core epitope FLPSDFFPSV is listed 56 times). This complicates the search for individual epitopes.I believe, it would strongly help if additional information about the assay used for identification of the epitope was included in the database. It is quite different if an epitope was experimentally confirmed by a functional assay or HLA class I-multimers, if HLA class I-peptide-binding was determined or if the epitope was only predicted
in silico.Do the authors consider including CD4+ T cell epitopes as well? Is there a rational why the database is limited to CD8+ T cell epitopes?

This systematic literature review has clearly been a heavily manual effort as information is so dispersed. The two online bibliographic databases that were selected to undertake targeted searches, Medline and Embase, may not offer 100% coverage and what about other resources in other languages? The ‘universe’ is not explicitly mentioned in the paper and needs to be added.Technology and sustainability I found the website easy to use, but at times, unstable, with multiple crashes on the site/ disconnection from the server. It is good to see the use of open source tools, for example, Shiny R. The interactivity is quite basic, based on column sorting (effectively an online spreadsheet) but nevertheless useful. I found the feedback and contributor process to be manual and quite primitive, through what is essentially a minimally structured paper-based form. It would nice to see a more automated upload process with structured fields available for population and validation on the fly; and some local vetting once an entry is submitted. In terms of future proofing and keeping data up to date, the team note that they have an ongoing remit to develop this into a sustainable open-access online research resource that evolves over time. While the code is usefully for the datatable available on 
Github, it is not that clear how any maintenance of the project might be supported and under what budget. The team have promised to continue to refine and update this resource, yet what happened if key staff leave? Future proofing is the main concern of so many local resources like this, which is why the Research Council’s typically try not to fund on-going longer-term information resources under the auspices of smaller one-off research projects due to the lack of future accessibility. ESRC have set up a centralised web based ReStore to ensure that their web-based research methods resources created under one-time research awards are maintained in the longer term – either as maintained resources or static snaphot web-based resources. So may resources created with the very best intentions, are not kept up to date and may become out of date quickly, and this become a relic While I really embrace the idea of crowd sourcing information to maintain future, in my opinion the physical resource /database (the catalogue) should be looked after by an official long standing trusted repository e.g. Genbank and not an individual university. The fact that the authors mention another almost identical on-line database of epitopes, but for HIV ((
https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/ctl_search), and other online repositories in the field of HIV T cell immunology (sequence data including HBV-specific databases 
https://hbvdb.ibcp.fr/HBVdb/
2 and 
http://www.hepseq.org, and in broader sequence repositories, such as 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) makes me wonder why a unified database has not been proposed with a single interface! The last thing the community needs is a proliferation of locally managed lists so why not combine them into one infrastructure? This professionalised future proofing of resources like this really needs to be addressed in the paper, even if they are aspirational. Finally, if the web resource/front end was not to be retained in the future this snapshot database is usefully backed up in Figshare. The paper says the team will keep this updated, but it is not clear how future dumps of the dataset might be formally archived, persistently cited, and referenced in Figshare and how formal versioning might work. Will Oxford and Fighare sync their versions? This area needs to be addressed to make it clear they have really considered future plans for this useful table of information.I have read this submission.

The authors need to be congratulated for their effort to set up a clear and user friendly resource that provides all the current scientific information known on HBV epitopes at present.  What I found particularly nice is that it details how the different epitopes were experimentally determined and this allow the user to understand whether the epitope was able to induce a T cell response in a subject with natural infection or was only the result of
in silico determination and binding assays. Such a resource will allow easy progression of future research in T cell immunology. Researchers will have access to the information on relevant HBV epitopes in one dataset, which will be both convenient and time-saving. In addition as noted, the experimental technique of epitope determination is noted which can further direct experimental design. As noted by the authors, the resource, will hopefully, can continue to grow, certainly  considering the number of people who are screening HBV patients, this might not be a trivial task. In addition it is also of value that comments from readers can be added and thus allow authors to update the resource as appropriate. Thus the importance being that the resource will evolve over time and therefore be an invaluable asset in HBV research. The authors of the manuscript/resource have clearly outlined their methods for the literature search in developing the interactive database which are robust. I also note the limitations of dataset validation, whereby citations could be overlooked as they are not search specific. However, accepting this I have a couple of suggestions, that I hope can be useful to improve the utility of the site:  
The data gathered do not appear to be consolidated and as such do not generate a “final” state of knowledge on HBV epitopes landscape. The website provides all the information but they are listed as a list of papers. This can create potential confusion, since for example if you are interested to know whether the core 18-27 FLPSDFFPSV epitope comprises a polymorphism (which it does) you need to ask this information when you are reading the relevant paper, where such polymorphism was demonstrated. If you are asking this identical question starting from a paper where such polymorphism was not analyzed, the answer is that there is no polymorphism in this region. I think this is an aspect that could be improved since it might generate some misinterpretation. A similar problem is also present in relation to the impact of HLA-A02 subtypes. Some epitopes are presented as pan A2 based on old papers but more recent publication  (Tan AT 
et al. 2008) have show that some epitopes are exclusively A0201. For example the envelope epitopes FLLTRILTI or FLLTKILTI were demonstrated exclusively on HLA-A0201 subjects and not on HLA-A0203, 0206, 0207 subjects.) The progressive evolution of information is somehow lost. Thus at places where the term ‘pan’ is used this may need to be verified as new data may not corroborate this. Having said that I appreciate the limitations, as noted in the manuscript regarding data validation. When asking for a list of, for example, HBV epitopes within the core region, the web site provides all the papers where core epitopes were demonstrated but there is a lot of redundancy. There are 6 pages listing all the papers published using the core 18-27 epitope. I am wondering whether there could be a method to first list all the different epitopes with the indication of the number of publications where such epitope was reported as a measure of the evidence supporting the validity of the epitope. This may be a method to improve the resource.The description given in the database for the method of epitope characterization is very detailed, but what may not immediately be clear is whether the method used is accurate enough to give you real HBV epitopes.  For example, if the epitopes were characterized using the T cells from naturally infected patients and targets where HBV proteins were endogenously processed, that would be ideal. If the epitope was only characterized by predictive algorithms, then it would be less so. Perhaps a scale (Patient T cells with endogenously processed epitopes > Patient T cells with peptide pulsed targets > binding assays > predictive algorithms) indicating the validity of the consolidated epitopes might be clearer for the users of the database. As some citations may have been missed due to the search criteria, it may be a possibility to widen the search. This may be more feasible once readers have provided feedback. This will allow the search to be increased possibly to include all the relevant data for the resource.

Variation of two independent experiments looks high. It is partly because they judged by only plate works. To be truly respiration defective, the authors are better to measure oxygen consumption of the mutants. That is the definition of respiration deficiency.Did the authors find out the mutants that are required for glycerol metabolism but not relevant to respiration? Did the authors omit these mutants from the list of respiration defective mutants. I could not reach the list of the mutants the authors selected.We are also using a deletion mutant library of Bioneer Corp. It still contains the strains that are not deleted properly or apparently possess extragenic unknown mutation(s). Several must-be-respiration defective mutants such as coenzyme Q less mutants we are studying

1 it differs in several important aspects:
A more up-to-date version of the gene deletion set is used.An improved method for generating a prototrophic gene deletion library is employed.Colonies are screened at lower densities allowing for more accurate measurements. Taken together, these changes both improve the quality of the data set and provide novel information. The methods used for screening and data analysis are rigorous and clearly described.  All data have been deposited to the Open Science Foundation website and are freely available. The quality of the data set is supported by the fact that the identified genes are indeed enriched for those encoding mitochondrially localised proteins (as one would expect in a screen for respiratory deficient mutants). It should also be noted that many of the fission yeast hits in the screen have not been identified in budding yeast. I thus feel that the data represent an important, novel, and useful foundational resource for those with an interest in energy metabolism. The data also provide useful information with respect to various technical aspects of performing genome-wide screens. First, the authors - perhaps not surprisingly - show that the results of the screen are affected by the presence/absence of auxotrophic markers. Second, the study reveals large variability between biological repeats. While these results are somewhat troubling - in the sense that they make interpretation of this and other genome-wide screens more difficult - it is nevertheless critically important that researchers be made aware of:

S. pombe. It differs from their previous study, in that an improved and more complete version of the deletion library was used, the method for transferring the deletions into a prototrophic background has been improved, colony sizes were determined at a much lower density and galactose medium was no longer used. Taken together, these changes should give a simpler and more robust dataset. The methods used to produce and analyze the dataset are clearly and succinctly explained and the treated and raw data are available in the Supplementary Tables. The authors find that, as they have previously shown, that approximately twice as many genes are identified in the auxotroph compared to the prototroph screen. This is no surprise, auxotrophic background is known to modify phenotypes, in particular
ura4 mutations often exacerbate respiratory phenotypes. Indeed, it could be argued that in future, resources would be better used if more biological repetitions were performed to produce a more robust dataset, rather than comparing auxotrophs with prototrophs. To my mind the most surprising, and perhaps worrying, result is the large differences seen between the biological repeats (Figure 1D) for both the prototroph and auxotroph strains. This is surprising as the “biological repeat” was essentially taking the strains out of the freezer, and they underwent two rounds of glucose growth before being tested for respiratory growth. This is an observation that requires further investigation; yeast biology would not be where it is today if strains had a 50% chance of changing their phenotype every time they came out of the freezer. The analysis in Figure 1D-F is interesting, I realize that this is a data note, not an article, but I have not been able to find the corresponding Tables it in the supplementary data.

It is good to see that both the software and data are also freely available. The description of the architecture and rationale are clearly presented, but I think the paper needs some refocusing. There are many existing similar platforms for displaying such metadata, and thus the concept itself is far from novel. It is unclear how the SciLite approach in principle differs from such existing platforms. The second paragraph of the Introduction provides some references to these, which is used as evidence of the importance of this kind of tool, along with the current development of new infrastructures such as OpenMinTed, but some explanation of how SciLite could (or could not) be integrated with these would be useful. What is interesting in this work is the particular focus on the biological data and the underlying approach to annotation, but this is treated rather superficially in the paper. Something which concerns me a little is that the approach to annotation itself seems rather shallow – this may simply due to the brevity of description and the focus more on architectural aspects. In the Introduction, Semantic Web Technologies are mentioned, but I recommend going a little bit beyond the concept that “ontologies are useful” and explaining in more detail how they help with the task. From the description of the annotation process and visualisation, this is not apparent, although linking terms to ontologies offers great potential for enhanced visualization and exploration for the end-user (though it’s not clear whether this is offered in the platform, and if not, why not). The authors claim that “when such information is presented effectually it will aid users in identifying the main concepts” but it is not clear how this is possible in the current platform. Note also that “effectually” should be replaced with “effectively”. I would suggest expanding Section 2.2 to explain better the methodology for named entity extraction. From the description, the approach sounds rather simplistic, but I suspect that this description hides some complexity. A fuller description of the actual dictionary-based approach and spurious entity filtering techniques would be useful. The reference given is only a summary of dictionary-based approaches in general, but I couldn’t see anywhere a description of or link to the actual technique used in SciLite. It is also not clear how major issues such as entity disambiguation and variation are dealt with, in order to ensure correct linking to the ontology. In Figure 2, please make it clearer what the original text is from which the figure is derived. Figure 4 does not actually show the popup containing additional information about the annotation, but the text describing it indicates that it does. It would be useful to see this popup also. Section 2.5 goes into quite some detail about the interface, but most of this is rather standard technology used in most annotation/text mining GUIs (for instance, the mechanism for sorting the annotations to display) and could easily be omitted. In the last bullet point in this section, “correspondent” should be “corresponding”. In Section 2.6 (and throughout the paper), “setup” should be two words when used as a verb. In bullet point b, it is not clear what is meant by “relatively” here – I think this word could just be deleted. In Section 3, the presentation of the evaluation could do with being more detailed, as this is an important aspect of the platform. What does it really mean to say that “most people found at least 3 annotation types useful”? This is rather vague. How many annotation types were there in total? Did they find the actual annotations useful too? What about the ontologies and the popup information? How did they use the information shown to them, and how did it enhance their experience? What did they find not useful? Did they have suggestions for improvement? How accurate were the annotations? Are there any plans to provide relational information also (as it seems to be indicated by the users that this would be useful)?

For example, “web annotations such as, text…” should be “web annotations, such as text…” In summary, the work is interesting, but I think it could be enhanced greatly by a considerable rewrite with more focus on the underlying methodology and evaluation parts.I have read this submission.

Europe PMC is a database that is updated daily with new content and already has a large user base, so rather than expecting users to visit another interface, the text-mining results are incorporated into their usual search behaviour. SciLite complements OpenMinTed in that the outputs from such infrastructures, which is focussed on the needs of text miners rather than end users, can be made widely and publically available. This aspect has been included in section 3.1.*What is interesting in this work is the particular focus on the biological data and the underlying approach to annotation, but this is treated rather superficially in the paper.Something which concerns me a little is that the approach to annotation itself seems rather shallow – this may simply due to the brevity of description and the focus more on architectural aspects.

Since the Europe PMC text mining pipeline also serves as a provider for SciLite we briefly mention the steps involved, citing the articles in which the methodology of these steps are described.*In Figure 2, please make it clearer what the original text is from which the figure is derived.We have simplified Figures 2 and 3. The figure legends now describe the sample model with links to the source articles that contains the original annotation.*Figure 4 does not actually show the popup containing additional information about the annotation, but the text describing it indicates that it does. It would be useful to see this popup also.The correction has now been made, the text now refers to Figure 6 which includes a popup window and an example link has been included for the same.*Section 2.5 goes into quite some detail about the interface, but most of this is rather standard technology used in most annotation/text mining GUIs (for instance, the mechanism for sorting the annotations to display) and could easily be omitted. In the last bullet point in this section, “correspondent” should be “corresponding”.We agree with the point being made. We have now reworked the section providing concise description of the highlighting process.*In Section 2.6 (and throughout the paper), “setup” should be two words when used as a verb.We have now made the necessary corrections throughout the article.*In bullet point b, it is not clear what is meant by “relatively” here – I think this word could just be deleted.Step b requires the providers to make necessary improvements to their algorithms and this is more time consuming than step a, which is a “quick fix”. The text has been rephrase, we hope the sentence reads better.*In Section 3, the presentation of the evaluation could do with being more detailed, as this is an important aspect of the platform. What does it really mean to say that “most people found at least 3 annotation types useful”? This is rather vague. How many annotation types were there in total? Did they find the actual annotations useful too? What about the ontologies and the popup information? How did they use the information shown to them, and how did it enhance their experience? What did they find not useful? Did they have suggestions for improvement? How accurate were the annotations?We agree with the point being made with regards to user research. Section 3 has been expanded, providing details on how the usability tests were conducted, aspects of SciLite that the users liked and how we improved SciLite based on the feedback we received.*Are there any plans to provide relational information also (as it seems to be indicated by the users that this would be useful)?SciLite now includes gene-disease relationship provided by two contributors (Open Targets platform and DisGeNET) and protein-protein interactions from IntAct. To accommodate the latest development we have expanded sub-section 2.2*There are tools that already can provide this kind of information, see for example GATE’s Prospector tool:V. Tablan, K. Bontcheva, I. Roberts, and H. Cunningham. Mímir: An open-source semantic search framework for interactive information seeking and discovery. Journal of Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 2014.We have now reworked the manuscript focusing on SciLite as a platform for bringing various text mined annotations to the wider scientific community. In this sense, we believe that Mímir (as a search framework) is broader in its application when compared to SciLite.*A final point – throughout the paper, the authors have added a comma after the phrase “such as”. The comma should precede this phrase. For example, “web annotations such as, text…” should be “web annotations, such as text…”We have edited the text for grammatical corrections and hope that the text now reads significantly better!",4,7,2017,2017-7-4,PMC5527546,Software Tool Article,28948232,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10210.2,SciLite: a platform for displaying text-mined annotations as a means to link research articles with biological data.,2016-01-01,research-article; journal article; 
Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.10999.r18964,Harland,Lee,NA,"1Scibite Limited, Cambridge, UK",approve-with-reservations,"* This article describes the ""SciLite"" tool for enriching biomedical articles with annotations derived from text mining and other sources and the benefits such an approach has for users. It is well written and referenced and outlines the principles in a consistent way. The application links at the bottom of the article pointed to valid working websites. I think it valid to review both the paper and the tool itself and all of the functionality I tried on the website worked very well and there were no software errors, validating that the system is running as described in the paper. In terms of areas for consideration: * The introduction is fine, the major omission being coverage of previous work on in-line biological annotation, I would strongly support the acknowledgement of the reflect.ws tool which was perhaps the most prominent one here - and note that many biological web page annotators, both commercial and non-commercial exist (e.g. EXTRACT https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baw005/2630147/EXTRACT-interactive-extraction-of-environment which works very well on the Europe PMC website). The introduction should clarify the advantages the authors approach brings over 3rd party, javascript bookmarklet approaches. * Its not clear what the actual tagging methodology is 2.2 states ""Named entity taggers: the module is based on the dictionary-based approach (Rebholz-Schuhmann
et al., 2008) combined with a machine-learning based filter (Chang
et al., 2007), for filtering out potential false positives in annotations."". Does this use these existing tools or have the authors invented new ones and which vocabularies were used? I think those in the text mining field would be interested to know more about how the text mining is done [I would agree this is not a text mining methods paper, but this is very light on detail here]. Maybe I missed it but ""Sentence splitter: an in-house module to identify sentence boundaries."" could also do with some form of definition (what's it based on, were any improvements needed etc, the tool correctly doesn't split 'Nkx6.1' so there is some logic being coded there). * The use of RDF is interesting but no justification is given as to what advantages RDF provides over other database mechanisms. Why was RDF chosen over other systems? It seems that the queries are fairly straight forward (for an input ID give me annotations) and I'm not sure they require RDF necessarily. There are genuine other reasons I could think of but it would be good for the authors to describe this choice. Indeed the authors then state they are considering use of MongoDb (using RDF or not?). This seems to hint at some problems using RDF, but no information is given. I think the authors either need to describe why or perhaps remove this sentence entirely as these seems like more internal technical discussion? * The system performed well for human centric articles but less so when looking at plant or bacterial data... This is a really hard problem in text mining and I don't expect the authors to solve it here but it would be good to perhaps outline whether the system could be tuned to address anything here as non-human area researchers will be using the tool. * 2.6.a When error reported there is a ""Quick fix"" where the annotation is deleted. It is not clear if this is just for that 1 article or all articles as it may be an erroneous synonym? While 2.6.b hints to this ""refine the  text-mining algorithm."" it gives no detail as to what this entails. Again, this is not a text mining methods paper, but examples would be useful here. * Further, Figure 1 - doesnt touch on maintainence. When source vocabs change (e.g. as 2.6.b hints) do all articles need to be re-run? Are there version markers on the annotations? How regularly are older articles re-annotated?  Is provenance applied to annotations, I didn't see any void/prov markers in Figure 2. * Following on the provenance theme, the authors state: ""Additionally, the open architecture of SciLite... data for clear provenance of curatorial statements."". I think this is shown in Figure 3 but only if you know what the RDF prefixes for void and prov mean, so perhaps should be described in the main article text for non RDF people. * Finally, section (2) talks about the systems handling of false positives but does not mention false negatives at all which are equally irritating to the user. What is the proposed approach here? * 3. ""Everyone preferred annotations to be turned off by default."" - I think thats a fairly important statement, did you ask why? * The link to the Sparql end point http://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/rdf/sparql provides only a default view and it is left to the user to figure out the schema and queries necessary. I am not sure of the best mechanism (supplementary data or footnote?) but an example query or two would be very helpful to get started * In general, figures could do with a bit more description as to what they are showing.I have read this submission.

NA,NA,Venkatesan,Aravind,NA,"EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, UK",NA,"Dear Lee Harland,Thank you for providing your inputs with regard to our paper. We have reworked the manuscript, addressing your suggestions.Overview of the changes made are as follows:
Section 1. Introduction: The section has being restructured and now acknowledges contributions made by other annotation tools.Section 2. Methods:
Sub-section 2.1 (Architecture) now provides an overview of the architecture of SciLite (includes new figure 1)Sub-section 2.2 (Annotation types) has been expand to include new annotations types (gene-disease relationships and manually curated protein-protein interactions).Sub-section 2.3 describes the Web Annotation model (includes new figures: 2 and 3).Sub-section 2.4 (User interface) has been reworked to provide concise description of the highlighting process.Sub-section 2.5 now includes a new figure (4) that provides an overview on the feedback mechanism. 
Section 3. Discussion: The section now provides details on how the user research was conducted. The section has been restructured with two new sub sections:
3.1 – Engagement with text-mining community3.2 – Future directions.
Supplementary material: The supplementary material provides details on the classes and relations used to model the annotations as RDF along with sample SPARQL queries. We think that the manuscript is much improved as a result of your feedback. Please see a point-by-point response, below:  * The introduction is fine, the major omission being coverage of previous work on in-line biological annotation, I would strongly support the acknowledgement of the reflect.ws tool which was perhaps the most prominent one here - and note that many biological web page annotators, both commercial and non-commercial exist (e.g. EXTRACT https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baw005/2630147/EXTRACT-interactive-extraction-of-environment which works very well on the Europe PMC website). The introduction should clarify the advantages the authors approach brings over 3rd party, javascript bookmarklet approaches.We have now added a paragraph in the Introduction section acknowledging the contributions made by other annotation tools. The section highlights the rationale behind the development of SciLite in comparison with other tools.The main advantage of SciLite is that the platform aggregates annotations made by different tools. For instance, if desired annotations made by Reflect or Extract can be shared in SciLite. This allows users to view different types of annotations for a given article on Europe PMC website.* Its not clear what the actual tagging methodology is 2.2 states ""Named entity taggers: the module is based on the dictionary-based approach (Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2008) combined with a machine-learning based filter (Chang et al., 2007), for filtering out potential false positives in annotations."". Does this use these existing tools or have the authors invented new ones and which vocabularies were used? I think those in the text mining field would be interested to know more about how the text mining is done [I would agree this is not a text mining methods paper, but this is very light on detail here]. Maybe I missed it but ""Sentence splitter: an in-house module to identify sentence boundaries."" could also do with some form of definition (what's it based on, were any improvements needed etc, the tool correctly doesn't split 'Nkx6.1' so there is some logic being coded there).The purpose of SciLite is to be a platform for sharing the text mining work of others, so in a sense the text mining methodology used by contributors is not the business of SciLite. However, as the Europe PMC text mining pipeline also serves as a provider for SciLite we have briefly mentioned the steps involved and referred to the articles in which the methodology of these steps is described.* The use of RDF is interesting but no justification is given as to what advantages RDF provides over other database mechanisms. Why was RDF chosen over other systems? It seems that the queries are fairly straight forward (for an input ID give me annotations) and I'm not sure they require RDF necessarily. There are genuine other reasons I could think of but it would be good for the authors to describe this choice. Indeed the authors then state they are considering use of MongoDb (using RDF or not?). This seems to hint at some problems using RDF, but no information is given. I think the authors either need to describe why or perhaps remove this sentence entirely as these seems like more internal technical discussion?We agree with the point being made. Based on our performance tests we find MongoDB to be more performant for retrieving annotations for a given PMCID. Whereas, RDF is a natural choice for linked data and is suitable for performing graph-based queries.   We have now restructured parts of the section to highlight this point, correspondingly we have changed Figure 1.   * The system performed well for human centric articles but less so when looking at plant or bacterial data... This is a really hard problem in text mining and I don't expect the authors to solve it here but it would be good to perhaps outline whether the system could be tuned to address anything here as non-human area researchers will be using the tool.Our approach to resolving the challenges of text mining across different fields and phylogenies is to engage the text mining community to provide their insights and solutions in SciLite. This key message of the article has been reworked to be much clearer (we acknowledge that some of the original phrasing was misleading).* 2.6.a When error reported there is a ""Quick fix"" where the annotation is deleted. It is not clear if this is just for that 1 article or all articles as it may be an erroneous synonym?“Quick fix” is only for the specific instance in a specific article where an error was reported, as means of a quick response to user feedback. We have another mechanism which allows providers to correct their algorithms to reduce errors globally. This method could be improved further in the future to extend the deletion of a specific instance to “all instances in the article”, for example.*While 2.6.b hints to this ""refine the text-mining algorithm."" it gives no detail as to what this entails. Again, this is not a text mining methods paper, but examples would be useful here.Error reports are submitted to the corresponding provider as refining text mining algorithms is not part of the SciLite workflow. However, improvements would entail, for instance, revising dictionaries by removing erroneous synonyms.* Further, Figure 1 - doesnt touch on maintenance. When source vocabs change (e.g. as 2.6.b hints) do all articles need to be re-run? Are there version markers on the annotations? How regularly are older articles re-annotated?  Is provenance applied to annotations, I didn't see any void/prov markers in Figure 2.In SciLite when new dataset is submitted, all annotations are checked and in cases where the annotations have changed the corresponding collections (in MongoDB) and the RDF triples are updated. When new data set is available the provenance graphs are updated. Figure 1 has been replaced with a new Figure, the figure now provides an overview of the SciLite workflow, touching upon the maintenance aspect.Figure 2 has been modified to refocus on the representation of annotations in the Web Annotation model. We hope the new figure is more understandable to the readers.* Following on the provenance theme, the authors state: ""Additionally, the open architecture of SciLite... data for clear provenance of curatorial statements."". I think this is shown in Figure 3 but only if you know what the RDF prefixes for void and prov mean, so perhaps should be described in the main article text for non RDF people.In the indicated sentence we were referring to annotations as textual evidence and were not referring to “provenance” in the context of RDF. We acknowledge that the usage of the phrase was misleading, we have now rephrased the sentence.* Finally, section (2) talks about the systems handling of false positives but does not mention false negatives at all which are equally irritating to the user. What is the proposed approach here?You have hit on a tricky problem: how to report a false negative. Without an easy way for people to, for example, highlight text and add a comment, it will be a cumbersome task to report false negatives. It is possible that solutions such as hypothes.is could help here, especially given that both SciLite and  hypothes.is  use the Web Annotation standard; we plan to explore these options in the future.* 3. ""Everyone preferred annotations to be turned off by default."" - I think thats a fairly important statement, did you ask why?Based on the user feedback, we find that annotations highlighted (in different colours) by default are distracting to the user. Hence, the users preferred to choose the type of annotations that are of interest to them.We have expanded the section explaining the process of testing SciLite with the users and describe the feedback we received.* The link to the Sparql end point http://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/rdf/sparql provides only a default view and it is left to the user to figure out the schema and queries necessary. I am not sure of the best mechanism (supplementary data or footnote?) but an example query or two would be very helpful to get startedWe agree with the point being made, we have now added Supplementary material with details of relations and classes used along with sample queries. We also plan on releasing a RESTful API on the annotations within the next few months* In general, figures could do with a bit more description as to what they are showing.We have extended the figure legends to be more descriptive.",4,7,2017,2017-7-4,PMC5527546,Software Tool Article,28948232,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10210.2,SciLite: a platform for displaying text-mined annotations as a means to link research articles with biological data.,2016-01-01,research-article; journal article; 
Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.10999.r18949,Hirschman,Lynette,NA,"1Biomedical Informatics, MITRE Corporation, Bedford, MA, 01730, USA",approve-with-reservations,"The article describes the SciLite project and capability; SciLite opens exciting new possibilities by supporting the automated tagging (and indexing) of biological entities. The article presents the background behind the development of these capabilities and a description of both the capabilities and the underlying components. Overall, the article provides a clear presentation of the rationale for SciLite, a useful description of the underlying approach and architecture, and a good bibliography referencing many of the key works related to automated extraction of bio-entities. However, there are several places which need clarification or elaboration, including 1) whether SciLite can extract the “essence” of an article; 2) explanations of the contents (and abbreviations) of Figs 2 and 3 – and how they relate to the text descriptions in the article; 3) some discussion of how to handle multiple sources for the same information, and 4) a link to (a demo of) SciLite, to allow interested people to explore this new capability. In addition, there are some detailed minor questions/suggestions at the end of the review.  
Capturing the “essence” of an article: In the description of capabilities, there is one statement that requires either rethinking or further explanation: “When such information [referring to text-mined, linked entities] is presented effectually it will aid users in identifying the main concepts, plausibly beginning to reduce the burden of extracting the essence of a given article.” (p. 2, col. 2, para. 3) There is a danger that tagging of entities in full text articles can overwhelm the user, rather than giving them a sense of the essence of an article. It may be true that tagging entities in an
abstract might make the key entities jump out; or that providing a summary table listing the most frequently mentioned entities might provide such an overview of “main concepts” – but simply tagging many types of entities (especially if there are false positives in the tagging) can quickly overwhelm the user.Explaining Figs 2 and 3: These figures each need a paragraph or so of text to explain what is being illustrated, and how to read the graph displayed. For Fig 2., it would be very helpful to see the actual annotation generated (in its textual context); it would be good to gloss the various abbreviations in the graph (what is oa as a prefix? What is orb? What are the urls and their suffixes #1-2s and #1-2t? What are the things in boxes? In the box on the lower left, Fig 2, why are there multiple quote marks: “CSF-1””induces expression…” and what do these mean?  For Fig 3, what are the items in the box with dashed lines in the upper left? What do the various terms dc, dcterms, orb, oa, void, prov mean? What is the actual example GeneRIF that is being constructed? And pretty much the same request as for Fig 2 – describe the contents of the figure in text, so that the reader can follow what is being shown. Handling of multiple sources of the same kind of information – given that there are multiple taggers for certain entities types (e.g., genes/proteins), will there be a capability for users to choose which tagger they want? Will there be a way for users to select high precision vs high recall? Will there be any attempt to create an ensemble system from multiple taggers?Please provide a link so that interested readers can explore SciLite.    Minor comments/questions: p.2 col. 1, para 1 middle – I couldn’t follow the second part of the sentence, starting with “where…”: “This workflow is highly interconnected and precise where the databases are both dependent and required for this practice.” p.2 col. 2 para 1: suggest replacing “instituted” with “fostered”. p.2. col. 2 para 2 top- suggest removing the first clause (it’s redundant) – e.g., remove “Having described the importance of information extraction by using text-mining methods in the context of aiding manual curation” – and just start the paragraph with “The other essential aspect…” p.2, col. 2 para 2 end: suggest changing “and integrate data” to “and integration of data” p. 2, col. 2, para 3 l 2: suggest changing “mechanism toward” to “mechanism to support” p.2. col. 2 last para: suggest changing “an aim to leverage text-mining solutions towards” to “an aim of leveraging text-mining solutions for” p. 5, section 2.5 on User Interface – would it be appropriate to cite the Reflect project here, as a groundbreaking application to provide enriched metadata about objects in text?

Highlighting different annotation types could serve as an indicator (referred to in the text as “essence”) with respect to the key concepts described in a given paper. We have now rewritten the paragraph to avoid confusion.*Explaining Figs 2 and 3: These figures each need a paragraph or so of text to explain what is being illustrated, and how to read the graph displayed. For Fig 2., it would be very helpful to see the actual annotation generated (in its textual context); it would be good to gloss the various abbreviations in the graph (what is oa as a prefix?

And pretty much the same request as for Fig 2 – describe the contents of the figure in text, so that the reader can follow what is being shown.We agree that the figures could be confusing to readers with limited exposure to RDF concepts. We now briefly describe the Web Annotation Model (Sub-section 2.3), further, we have simplified Figures 2 and 3. The figure legends now describes the sample model with links that point to the source articles that contains the exemplified annotations. *Handling of multiple sources of the same kind of information – given that there are multiple taggers for certain entities types (e.g., genes/proteins), will there be a capability for users to choose which tagger they want? Will there be a way for users to select high precision vs high recall? Will there be any attempt to create an ensemble system from multiple taggers?SciLite can host similar semantic types from multiple sources. The platform allows users to choose relevant sources of their interest. However, it is unlikely that this would be of interest to the wider scientific community. Ideally SciLite would consume annotations through systems like BeCalm, allowing users access to benchmarked “high quality” annotations.   *Please provide a link so that interested readers can explore SciLite.SciLite platform is integrated in Europe PMC and can be seen in action on any CC-BY or CC-BY-NC article.

Therefore, the present work by the Zaratiegui and Bahler groups is important and will help to solve some issues. It is expected that the improvements presented here will spread within the community. A new selection is proposed for the Cas9 vector together with a new transformation method. A straightforward web tool is added to the already long list of very useful resources developed over the years by the Bahler lab. The manuscript is well written and most of the time easy to read. Solving the following issues will improve clarity.

In Figure 2, in « Table », the « numbers on the right » may be explained with a simple sentence. Also, the naming « Table » seems a bit odd. We have changed the title of this Table to ‘Suggested sgRNAs’ in both the web tool and in Figure 2. In the figure legend, we have also provided an explanation for the numbers on the right of the table.
The colour code used in Figures 3 and 4 is different for the sg primers, which may be misleading to some readers. We have now modified Figure 4 to match the color of the sgRNA primers with the ones in Figure 3.
In Figure 5, the red arrows do not seem to point to anything while supposed to highlight small colonies. Maybe using red circles will be better. We want to highlight the very smallest colonies because these are the most likely to be correct. In the screen version of the figure, these colonies are visible. We have increased the contrast to better visualize these colonies and now highlight small colonies using red circles as suggested.
Figure 6 is not easy to understand. According to Figure 6A, there are 29 deletions with a percentage of succesful deletions between 0 and 10% while the legend of Figure 6B suggests that 38 sgRNAs (36 sgRNAs #1 and 2 sgRNAs #2) did not yield to successful deletions. How is this possible? A table in the supplementary data may be easier to read if showing for every ncRNAs: the number of sgRNA tried and for each sgRNAs, the succes rate. The abscissa axis in Figure 6B is especially very hard to read. We understand that this was confusing. We have now corrected the x-axis of Figure 6A to indicate that the lowest bin contains 1-10% of successful deletions (instead of 0-10%). We have also clarified this in the figure legend. Here we only show the percentages of successful deletions. We did not add numbers for any unsuccessful deletions, because we cannot be certain whether they failed because of the sgRNA sequence, mutations in the plasmid, or any other reason. We now also provide a Supplementary Table 2 showing the data from Figures 6A and 6B, which is cited in the legend of Figure 6.
It would also be useful to discuss if the genome position matters and if the list of the targeted ncRNAs roughly covers the whole genome We have deleted ncRNA genes spread across all 3 chromosomes. We have now added an additional section C to Figure 6 to show the genomic positions of all annotated ncRNA genes (grey dots) and the ncRNA genes that we have successfully deleted (red dots). As for all genome manipulations, there may of course be genomic regions which are less amenable to changes, e.g. due to inaccessible chromatin.
The paragraph related to point mutations could provide more details or be removed and inserted later on when more data are available. We think that it is helpful to report at this point that it is also possible to get point mutations using our CRISPR/Cas9 method. We will expand on this in a future update of the paper.
It may be useful to mention that commercial kits are available to introduce the sgDNA into the vector, for example the BioLabs Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit that is inexpensive and efficient. We know this kits, but have optimized the conditions for the polymerase indicated. A different polymerase may require optimization of the initial PCR reaction, and the specific protocol provided may no longer be valid in all details. Naturally, other users can experiment with different procedures or kits, and we would be interested to hear of any alternatives that have been implemented.
The code on GitHub should be at least minimaly documented. We now provide basic documentation of the code in GitHub. The version of Pombase used to build the database should be indicated. The genome assembly is ASM294v2 and the annotation version 55, which is now specified in the text.

S. pombe (fission yeast). Their work builds on a previous paper by Jacobs, Zaratiegui
et al. (2014). In this earlier paper, Jacobs
et al. describe an expression vector for Cas9 and sgRNA that functions in
S. pombe and demonstrate that mutagenesis and epitope-tagging is possible with this system. Rodriguez-Lopez
et al. now make several changes to improve the efficiency and the ease of use.
The authors change the auxotrophic selection marker
ura4+ in the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid to a nourseothricin-resistance, which does not require a specific genetic background and allows selection on rich medium. Another group has recently implemented a fluoride export channel as another marker replacing
ura4+ on this plasmid, which also allows selection on rich medium and accelerates Cas9-mediated genome editing (Fernandez and Berro 2016). This also works well in our hands. I think it would be great if the authors cited this paper, so that readers are aware of all the different possibilities. Non-specific double-strand breaks created by Cas9 are always a concern, and it is important that the plasmid is efficiently lost after successful genome modification. With the
ura4+ version, 5-FOA could be used for counterselection. Since expression of Cas9 impairs growth, I am assuming that loss of the plasmid is very efficient, even without counterselection. However, if the authors happen to have data on this, it would be nice to mention it. (For example, how many clones lost the plasmid after one passage on non-selective medium?)The authors have written a program to select specific sgRNA target regions. The program then suggests primers for sgRNA cloning, as well as primers to delete a gene of interest and to check for successful deletion. This is generally very useful. When I tried the online version, I had no problem specifying a gene by name, but finding sgRNA targets by entering specific coordinates did not work for me (using two different browsers). My input caused an ""Internal Server Error"". It would be great if the authors could look into this. The current implementation of the program suggests sgRNA targets based on specificity, but - as the authors show - efficiency can be highly variable. For
S. pombe, there is no data available to indicate which target regions may be particularly efficient (and even in other organisms, information is still scarce). I was wondering whether it could be useful to extend the program to allow community feedback (i.e. when a researcher is using one of the suggested sgRNAs, she/he could input how well this site worked). This would (a) avoid that several people try using target regions that are not efficient, and (b) in the long run maybe allow it to determine which factors influence efficiency. Obviously, some sort of quality control on the user input would be required (e.g. number of successful genome modifications per how many clones tested, and a gel picture to support this), which may make it too time-consuming for the Bähler Lab to curate.The previous system needed digest of the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid with the restriction enzyme
CspCI, which sometimes is inefficient. The authors have now solved this problem by amplification of the entire 11 kb plasmid with primers that contain the specificity region, followed by ligation. This seems more inconvenient than is necessary. However, the authors already mention that they work on other improved strategies for the sgRNA cloning step that they will add to the paper as they are implemented. I agree that this will be highly useful. The authors have further improved an existing protocol for
S. pombe transformation to increase transformation and deletion efficiency. Figure 5 shows that G1 synchronization greatly improves transformation efficiency. If the authors happen to have data to which extent the cryopreservation affects this result, it would be great if they could add it.   Overall, these are all highly useful changes - a clear improvement over the previous protocol. Motivation and results are well described, and the step-by-step procedure is detailed and easy to follow.I have read this submission.

This also works well in our hands. I think it would be great if the authors cited this paper, so that readers are aware of all the different possibilities. We missed this paper, thank you. We have now cited it in the introduction. A drawback of is that fluoride selection requires a specific strain background.
Non-specific double-strand breaks created by Cas9 are always a concern, and it is important that the plasmid is efficiently lost after successful genome modification. With the ura4+ version, 5-FOA could be used for counterselection. Since expression of Cas9 impairs growth, I am assuming that loss of the plasmid is very efficient, even without counterselection. However, if the authors happen to have data on this, it would be nice to mention it. (For example, how many clones lost the plasmid after one passage on non-selective medium?) We have checked 106 colonies after one pass onto non-selective media, and 88 (83%) of these colonies have lost the plasmid passively.
The authors have written a program to select specific sgRNA target regions. The program then suggests primers for sgRNA cloning, as well as primers to delete a gene of interest and to check for successful deletion.This is generally very useful. When I tried the online version, I had no problem specifying a gene by name, but finding sgRNA targets by entering specific coordinates did not work for me (using two different browsers). My input caused an ""Internal Server Error"". It would be great if the authors could look into this. This bug has been corrected.
The current implementation of the program suggests sgRNA targets based on specificity, but - as the authors show - efficiency can be highly variable. For S. pombe, there is no data available to indicate which target regions may be particularly efficient (and even in other organisms, information is still scarce). I was wondering whether it could be useful to extend the program to allow community feedback (i.e. when a researcher is using one of the suggested sgRNAs, she/he could input how well this site worked).

Obviously, some sort of quality control on the user input would be required (e.g. number of successful genome modifications per how many clones tested, and a gel picture to support this), which may make it too time-consuming for the Bähler Lab to curate. Yes, we agree this is a good idea. As already mentioned in the paper, we are assembling a database with all sgRNAs used, whether they worked or not, to help with learning the principles for successful sgRNAs in
S. pombe. We may implement such a community system in a future update of the paper.
The previous system needed digest of the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid with the restriction enzyme CspCI, which sometimes is inefficient. The authors have now solved this problem by amplification of the entire 11 kb plasmid with primers that contain the specificity region, followed by ligation. This seems more inconvenient than is necessary. However, the authors already mention that they work on other improved strategies for the sgRNA cloning step that they will add to the paper as they are implemented. I agree that this will be highly useful.  We are working on a method to avoid the PCR cloning, and once this is implemented will report it in a future update of the paper.  
The authors have further improved an existing protocol for S. pombe transformation to increase transformation and deletion efficiency. Figure 5 shows that G1 synchronization greatly improves transformation efficiency. If the authors happen to have data to which extent the cryopreservation affects this result, it would be great if they could add it. We have not systematically checked to what extent cryopreservation helps, but it improves the procedure in our hands. In the original paper describing the protocol, Suga et al. report that the solution containing glycerol used as cryoprotectant improves efficiency:
“T
hese permeating agents have an ability not only to cryoprotect cells but also to improve transformation efficiency, and glycerol was a more effective agent for Sz. pombe cells. Thus, the thawed competent cells could be used directly for transformation without removing the glycerol because the presence of glycerol in the transformation mixture was important.”
 But the G1 synchronization seems to make an even a bigger difference, and we have further specified this in the legend of Figure 5. Transformation of synchronous cells consistently resulted in 3-fold to over 1000-fold higher numbers of colonies than transformation of asynchronous cells.",21,12,2016,2016-12-21,PMC5445975,Method Article,28612052,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.10038.3,A CRISPR/Cas9-based method and primer design tool for seamless genome editing in fission yeast.,2016-01-01,methods-article; journal article;

et al describes that multiSUMOylation of a target protein (ETV4) can be equally well recognised by RNF4, offering an alternative recruitment mechanism to the well known polySUMOylation signal that is recognised by this SUMO-dependent ubiquitin ligase. Authors propose this polySUMO/multiSUMO RNF4 recruitment as a widespread mechanism for this ubiquitin ligase. Further experiments will be required to conclude on the possible molecular and biological differences between the recruitment of RNF4 through poly vs multiple SUMOylation signals. The authors present a clear set of data indicating that SUMOylation of ETV4 is required for the interaction of RNF4. In this interaction the SUMO-interacting motifs (SIM) 2 and 3 of RNF4 play a critical role. However, one of the main data supporting the role of the multi-SUMOylation (Figure 1C) lacks quality. In fact, its difficult to observe multi-SUMOylated material in the condition with SUMO3 (K11R). Since the “in bacteria” modification system is not very efficient in terms of production of SUMOylated proteins, perhaps an “in vitro” all recombinant SUMOylation system can be used instead to pull down RNF4 WT. In such experiment ETV4 modified with SUMO3 vs SUMO3(K11R) can be compared. Alternatively, authors can use the same conditions than Figure 1B to pull-down recombinant RNF4. This data will support the actual information. Minor comments and suggestions:

This data will support the actual information.Response: The referee indicates that the amount of SUMOylation present from the bacterial expression system is low, and therefore provides low stoichiometry which could be improved. However, the critical thing is whether this level of SUMOylation is sufficient to mediate RNF4 binding. We have now included two additional lanes from the original gel that proves that this is the case and we have sufficient SUMOylation. These lanes include a non-SUMOylatable ETV4 derivative that lacks four consensus SUMOylation motifs, and therefore lacks evidence of any multi- and poly-SUMOylation. This mutant ETV4 binds very little RNF4, thereby demonstrating the importance of multi-SUMOylation in this binding event.

Referee response for version 1,10.21956/wellcomeopenres.10706.r17628,Hunter,Tony,NA,"1Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA",approve,"Here the authors have extended their studies of sumoylation of the ETS family transcription factor, ETV4. They have previously reported that ETV4 K96, K222 and K256, which lie in sumoylation consensus sequences, are sumoylated, and shown that sumoylated ETV4 is a target for the RNF4 SUMO-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase (STUbL). Here, they demonstrated that ETV4 is multi-sumoylated when co-expressed in HEK293T cells together with UBE2/UBC9, PIAS4 and WT SUMO3 or K11R SUMO3. Since K11R SUMO3 cannot form SUMO chains, they deduced that the slowly migrating sumoylated forms of ETV4 detected contain mono-SUMO3 adducts at multiple sites rather than SUMO chains. Bead-bound sumoylated GST-ETV4 brought down RNF4 efficiently, whereas mutant GST-ETV4 lacking pairs of the identified sumoylation sites bound less RNF4, and mutant GST-ETV4 lacking 4 SUMO sites (including K328) brought down no detectable RNF4. Next they assessed the importance of the individual SIMs in the RNF4 tetra-SIM array for binding multi-sumoylated ETV4, by mutating SIM consensuses singly and in combination, concluding that the central SIM2 and SIM3 motifs contribute most significantly to the binding of RNF4 to multi-sumoylated ETV4, as others have found for RNF4 binding to poly-SUMO chains. They conclude that RNF4 can recognize multi-monosumoylated proteins through its SIM array, in addition to proteins with poly-SUMO chains. Overall, the experiments are described in sufficient detail and the data are of good quality, providing strong experimental support for their conclusion that RNF4 can bind to multi-monosumoylated proteins through its array of four SIMs. This theoretical possibility had been proposed by others (e.g. Sun and Hunter (2012)), but it is important to have direct experimental validation of this concept, since the ability of RNF4 to bind to multi-monosumoylated proteins expands the range of possible targets for RNF4 STUbL-mediated ubiquitylation. One point that needs further discussion is the likely topology of binding of the RNF4 SIMs to a multi-monosumoylated protein such as ETV4. For instance, the schematic in panel D is not accurate in terms of the relative size of the sumoylated region in ETV4 and the size of the SIM domain in RNF4. Presumably, this region of ETV4 is flexible, but there would still need to be looping out of sequences between two adjacent SUMO residues for them to be able to bind simultaneously to SIMs 2 and 3 in a single RNF4 molecule. Some discussion of this point is merited. Other points:
Figure 1: The overall stoichiometry of ETV4 sumoylation in transfected HEK293 cells shown in panel B was low even under conditions designed to maximize sumoylation, i.e. there was a lot of unmodified ETV4. This might suggest that ETV4 sumoylation is cooperative, in the sense that sumoylated ETV4 molecules may be more susceptible than unmodified ETV4 to further sumoylation at additional sites. The patterns of sumoylated ETV4 bands in panels C and D which were obtained by co-expression of GST-ETV4 and the sumoylation machinery in bacteria are quite different from the pattern in panel B obtained in mammalian cells, and given the apparent size of the shift  of the bands near the top of the gel in the WT SUMO3 sample it seems likely that SUMO3 chains were attached, as the authors suggest. Unfortunately, the Ponceau stain is rather faint and it is hard to tell what bands are present in the K11R SUMO3 sample. Although the data in panel D suggest that ETV4 sumoylation site specificity is similar in bacterial and mammalian cells, one would like to see bacterial samples run side by side with sumoylated GST-ETV4 from mammalian cells (is it clear that there are no SUMO sites in GST?), and some discussion of sumoylation specificity in this bacterial system is desirable (the stoichiometry seems significantly higher than in mammalian cells), and in some ways it is surprising that adventitious sumoylation did not occur at nonconsensus sites in ETV4, particularly in the absence of SUMO proteases in the system. Did the authors confirm which Lys were sumoylated in the bacterial system using mass spec? Ideally, the experiments in panels D and E should be repeated with K11R SUMO3 to formally establish that RNF4 binding is not dependent to any extent on SUMO chain formation.Figure 2: The patterns of sumoylated ETV4 look different from those in Figure 1C-E. The patterns with WT SUMO3 could be due to polysumoylation, but the bands seem to be rather discrete for this, and there are more than 4 bands even with K11R SUMO3, as seen in panel C. Admittedly this could be because a single SUMO at different sites in ETV4 results in a different gel mobility, but this issue ought to be discussed.With regard to the topology of the binding of the RNF4 SIM array to SUMO chains or to multiple single SUMOs, further discussion of the structural insights into RNF4 SIM/SUMO interactions reported in Xu et al. (2014), and the importance of SIMs 2 and 3 in this interaction, is warranted.   Minor points:
In Figure 1A RNF4 is depicted with only 3 SIMs, possibly because ETV4 is shown with three SUMO sites or a SUMO chain with three residues. In contrast, RNF4 in Figure 2D is depicted with 4 SIMs in Figure 2D, which is the correct number of SIMs. I recommend changing Figure 1A to be consistent with Figure 2D. In addition, the legend to Figure 1 should indicate very clearly that the samples in panels C-E were obtained with ETV4 sumoylated in bacteria.In the experiments in Figure 2, MBP-RNF4 was used. Was MBP-RNF4 also used in the experiments in Figure 1C-E. If so this should be indicated? If not, how was recombinant RNF4 purified for this experiment - only MBP-RNF4 is described in the Methods.

Figure 1: The overall stoichiometry of ETV4 sumoylation in transfected HEK293 cells shown in panel B was low even under conditions designed to maximize sumoylation, i.e. there was a lot of unmodified ETV4. This might suggest that ETV4 sumoylation is cooperative, in the sense that sumoylated ETV4 molecules may be more susceptible than unmodified ETV4 to further sumoylation at additional sites. The patterns of sumoylated ETV4 bands in panels C and D which were obtained by co-expression of GST-ETV4 and the sumoylation machinery in bacteria are quite different from the pattern in panel B obtained in mammalian cells, and given the apparent size of the shift  of the bands near the top of the gel in the WT SUMO3 sample it seems likely that SUMO3 chains were attached, as the authors suggest.

This confirms that SUMO chain formation is not needed for RNF4 binding (new Fig. 1F). We have not performed mass spectrometry on the bacterially generated SUMOylated ETV4. However, Fig. 1E and F demonstrate that removal of the mapped SUMOylation sites in ETV4 eliminates ETV4 SUMOylation in the bacterial expression system and this loss of SUMOylation results in the loss of the associated RNF4 binding ability. We altered the text of the paper to emphasise this point. 2. Figure 2: The patterns of sumoylated ETV4 look different from those in Figure 1C-E. The patterns with WT SUMO3 could be due to polysumoylation, but the bands seem to be rather discrete for this, and there are more than 4 bands even with K11R SUMO3, as seen in panel C. Admittedly this could be because a single SUMO at different sites in ETV4 results in a different gel mobility, but this issue ought to be discussed.Response: The differences in mobility likely result from differences in the mobility of branched chain SUMO conjugates, as the size of the ETV4 construct varies. Fig. 1B contains Flag staged ETV4 but Fig. 1D contains GST-ETV4(1-335) and Fig. 1C, E and F contain GST-ETV4(full-length). As the referee points out, the different bands can be the result of multiple different combinations of SUMO modifications where either single or multiple SUMO molecules are attached. We have now discussed this more in the paper. 3. With regard to the topology of the binding of the RNF4 SIM array to SUMO chains or to multiple single SUMOs, further discussion of the structural insights into RNF4 SIM/SUMO interactions reported in Xu et al. (2014), and the importance of SIMs 2 and 3 in this interaction, is warranted.Response: We have now added further discussion of this and how the structure reveals a more substantive role for SIM3 than previously appreciated. Minor points: 1. In Figure 1A RNF4 is depicted with only 3 SIMs, possibly because ETV4 is shown with three SUMO sites or a SUMO chain with three residues. In contrast, RNF4 in Figure 2D is depicted with 4 SIMs in Figure 2D, which is the correct number of SIMs. I recommend changing Figure 1A to be consistent with Figure 2D. In addition, the legend to Figure 1 should indicate very clearly that the samples in panels C-E were obtained with ETV4 sumoylated in bacteria.Response: We have now harmonised the two schematics to more accurately depict the interactions and protein structures under investigation. The legend to Fig. 1 has been modified to indicate the source of theSUMOylated GST-ETV4 proteins. 2. In the experiments in Figure 2, MBP-RNF4 was used. Was MBP-RNF4 also used in the experiments in Figure 1C-E. If so this should be indicated? If not, how was recombinant RNF4 purified for this experiment - only MBP-RNF4 is described in the Methods.Response: MBP-RNF4 was used throughout and this is now clearly indicated in the legend to Fig.1.",26,1,2017,2017-1-26,PMC5445624,Research Note,28612051,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.9935.2,RNF4 interacts with multiSUMOylated ETV4.,2016-01-01,research-article; journal article;
