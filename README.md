Wellcome Open Research - Exploration of year one data 

We investigate the publication metadata and related events on the Wellcome Open Research (WOR) publication platform, and consider all 192 publications which have been submitted between 17 October 2016 and 17 November 2017. The exploration is based on the following datasets:

* WOR publication data retrieved from Figshare on 28 November 2017 (Kiley, 2017b).

* Additional bibliographic information and event data from CrossRef and altmetrics data from altmetrics.com retrieved on 28 November 2018 (Jahn, 2017b).

* Data on F1000Research and WOR review reports and their status parsed from Europe PubMed Central on 10 January 2018 (Jahn, 2018).

For a summary on key aspects of the WOR dataset also compare Kiley (2017a). Our analysis offers some additional insights.
